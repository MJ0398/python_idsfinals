In this study, process parameters such as particle size, extraction time, solvent flowrate, temperature and pressure were studied on the extraction of essential oil from Swietenia mahagoni seeds by using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) extraction. Swietenia mahagoni seeds was extracted at a pressure of 20-30 MPa and a temperature of 40-60°C. The effect of particle size on overall extraction of essential oil was done at 30 MPa and 50°C while the extraction time of essential oil at various temperatures and at a constant pressure of 30 MPa was studied. Meanwhile, the effect of flowrate CO2 was determined at the flowrate of 2, 3 and 4 ml/min. From the experimental data, the extraction time of 120 minutes, particle size of 0.5 mm, the flowrate of CO2 of 4 ml/min, at a pressure of 30 MPa and the temperature of 60°C were the best conditions to obtain the highest yield of essential oil. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) is one of the most widely used polymers in the world, which is produced in high-capacity tubular and autoclave reactors. As the LDPE industry turn into more competitive and its market profit margins become tighter, manufacturers have to develop solutions to debottleneck the reactor output while abiding to the stringent product specification. A single polyolefin plant producing ten to forty grades of LDPE with various melt flow index (MFI), therefore understanding the reaction mechanism, the operating conditions as well as the dynamic behavior of tubular reactor is essential before any improvement can take place. In the present work, a steady state mathematical model representing a tubular reactor for the production of LDPE is simulated using MATLAB R2015a®. The model developed is a function of feed inlet, reactor jacket, single initiator injector and outlet stream. Analysis on the effect of initiator concentration (CI) shows sudden declining trend of initiator's concentration which indicates that all of the initiators are exhausted after polymerization reaction and no further reaction occur from this point onwards. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the concentration of initiator gives significant impact on reactor temperature's profile and monomer conversion rate, since higher initiator concentration promotes greater polymerization rate, and therefore leads to higher monomer conversion throughput. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'Understanding the influence of operating parameters towards cracking severity is paramount in ensuring optimum operation of an ethylene plant. However, changing the parameters in an actual plant for data collection can be dangerous. Thus, a simulation model for ethane steam cracking furnace is developed using ASPEN Plus for the assessment. The process performance is evaluated with cracking severity factors and main product yields. Three severity factors are used for evaluation due to their ease of measurement, which are methane yield (Ymet), Ethylene-Ethane Ratio (EER) and Propylene-Ethylene Ratio (PER). The result shows that cracking severity is primarily influenced by reactor temperature. Operating the furnace with coil outlet temperature ranging between 850°C to 950°C and steam-to-hydrocarbon ratio of 0.3 to 0.5 has led to optimum main product yield. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'A solution model consisted of two different monosaccharides namely xylose and glucose were separated using a pilot scale spiral wound cross-flow system. This system was equipped by a commercial spiral wound nanofiltration (NF) membrane, Desal-5 DK, having a molecular weight cut off (MWCO) of 150-300 g mol-1. The aim of this present work is to investigate the effect of the cross-flow parameters: the trans-membrane pressure (TMP) and the feed concentration (C0) on the xylose separation from glucose. The filtration experiments were carried out in total reflux mode with different feed concentration of 2, 5, and 10 g/L at different TMP of 5,8 and 10 bar. The performances of the NF membrane were evaluated by measuring the permeate flux and sugar rejection for each experiment. All the samples were quantified using a high performance liquid chromatography equipped by a fractive index detector. The experimental results indicated an increase in pressure from 5 to 10 bar which was a notable increase to the permeate fluxes from 2.66 × 10-3 to 4.14 × 10-3L m-2s-1. Meanwhile, an increase in the C0 increases the xylose rejection. At TMP of 10 bar and C0 of 5 g/L, the observed xylose rejection and glucose rejection were measured at 67.19% and 91.82%, respectively. The lower rejection in xylose than glucose suggested that larger glucose molecule were not able to easily pass through the membrane compared to the smaller xylose molecule. The results of this phenomena proved that NF with spiral wound configuration has the potential to separate xylose from glucose, which is valuable to the purification of xylose in xylose production as an alternative to chromatographic processes. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Agarwood commonly known as gaharu, aloeswood or eaglewood have been used as traditional medicine for centuries and its essential oil also being used as perfumery ingredients and aroma enhancers in food products. However, there is least study on the agarwood leaves though it contains large number of biomolecules component that show diverse pharmacological activity. Previous study showed that the extracted compounds from the leaves possess activities like anti-mutagenic, anti-tumor and anti-helminthic. The main objectives of this research were to determine bioactive compounds in agarwood leaves leaves extract and oil yield obtained from maceration and soxhlet extraction methods respectively. The maceration process was performed at different operating temperature of 25°C, 50°C and 75°C and different retention time at 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes. Meanwhile, various solvents were used to extract the oil from agarwood leaves using soxhlet method which are hexane, water, isopropanol and ethanol. The extracted oil from agarwood leaves by soxhlet extraction was analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The results showed that the highest extract of 1.53% was obtained when increase the temperature to 75 °C and longest retention time of 120 minutes gave the highest oil yield of 2.10 % by using maceration. This is because at higher temperature enhances the solubility solute and diffusivity coefficient, thus increase the extract yield while longer retention time allow the reaction between solvent and solute occurred more rapidly giving higher extract. Furthermore, the soxhlet extraction using n-hexane as the solvent gave the highest oil yield as compared to other solvent due to the non-polar properties of n-hexane increase the efficiency of oil which is also non-polar to soluble in the solvent. In addition, the results also reported that the oil extracted from agarwood leaves contains bioactive compounds which are phytol, squalene, n-hexadecanoic acid and octadecatrienoic acid. Therefore, oil extracted from agarwood leaves has the potential to be applied in food, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and cosmetics industries. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Most hydrolysis studies on biomass in Malaysia produce high amount of xylose and glucose compared to other monosaccharides and most of them are acidic. Thin film composite (TFC) membrane developed via interfacial polymerization using triethanolamine (TEOA) and trimesoyl chloride (TMC) as monomers allows separation at low pH to occur without damaging its performance. Comparative studies were carried out on membranes with and without the thin film layer formed via interfacial polymerization on the polyethersulfone (PES) support. The surfaces of the membranes were characterized by field emission scanning electronic microscopy (FESEM), attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, and hydrophilicity via contact angle measurement. In addition, the performance and uncharged solute fouling behaviour of TFC membrane were also investigated. The TFC membrane used for characterization purposes was prepared at TEOA concentration of 4 % w/v in 1 × 10-6 M sodium hydroxide solution, TMC concentration of 0.25 % w/v in pure hexane, reaction time of 45 minutes, and cured at temperature of 60 °C. Characterization results showed a huge different between the synthesized TFC membrane and the un-synthesized PES membrane in term of surface properties and morphology. Nanofiltration results indicate that the formation of thin layer on top of PES support membrane improved the separation performance compared to PES support membrane. The synthesised polyester TFC membrane have irreversible fouling of 11.02 (±5.60) % and reversible fouling of 5.59 % using water as cleaning agent. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Supercritical Carbon Dioxide (SC-CO2) Extraction was applied to extract piper betel linn leaves. The piper betel leaves oil was used antioxidant, anti-diabetic, anticancer and antistroke. The aim of this study was to optimize the conditions of pressure, temperature and flowrate for oil yield and total phenolic content. The operational conditions of SC-CO2 studied were pressure (10, 20, 30 MPa), temperature (40, 60, 80 °C) and flowrate carbon dioxide (4, 6, 8 mL/min). The constant parameters were average particle size and extraction regime, 355pm and 3.5 hours respectively. First order polynomial expression was used to express the extracted oil while second order polynomial expression was used to express the total phenolic content and the both results were satisfactory. The best conditions to maximize the total extraction oil yields and total phenolic content were 30 MPa, 80 °C and 4.42 mL/min leading to 7.32% of oil and 29.72 MPa, 67.53 °C and 7.98 mL/min leading to 845.085 mg GAE/g sample. In terms of optimum condition with high extraction yield and high total phenolic content in the extracts, the best operating conditions were 30 MPa, 78 °C and 8 mL/min with 7.05% yield and 791.709 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g sample. The most dominant condition for extraction of oil yield and phenolic content were pressure and CO2 flowrate. The results show a good fit to the proposed model and the optimal conditions obtained were within the experimental range with the value of R2 was 96.13% for percentage yield and 98.52% for total phenolic content. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Carburizing process is a method to disperse carbon into the steel surface in order to enhance its mechanical properties such as hardness and wear resistance. This paper study investigates the effect of carburizing temperature to the carbon dispersion layer in stainless steel.

The effect of carbon dispersion layers were observed and the results indicated that the increasing value of the average dispersion layer from 1.30 mm to 2.74 mm thickness was found to be related to increment of carburizing holding temperature . The increment of carbon thickness layer also resulted in improvement of hardness and tensile strength of carburized stainless steel. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"Palm kernel shell filled recycled high density polyethylene (rHDPE/PKS) biocomposites were produced in order to reduce the waste product from palm oil production. The biocomposites at various filler loading were prepared by melt mixing at 180 °C. Ultra Plast TP0' was selected as coupling agent in rHDPE/PKS biocomposites, in order to modify the properties of biocomposites. It was found that the higher filler loading had reduced the melt flow index (MFI) values. However, with the increasing of testing temperature from 180 to 210 °C, the MFI values of the biocomposites were increased. The presence of Ultra Plast TP01was capable to increase MFI values of the biocomposites. The thermal studies showed that thermal stability of the biocomposites was affected by PKS loading and coupling agent. Though the thermal stability of biocomposites was reduced by PKS, it can be improved by Ultra Plast TP01. Hence, Ultra Plast TP01 can serve as an effective coupling agent for rHDPE/PKS. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'Location based service is an information and entertainment service, accessible with mobile devices through the mobile network and utilizing the ability to make use of the geographical position of the mobile device.

To that end, we mimick the flapping biomechanics of a dragonfly by two thin flat airfoils plunging in tandem with each other. In the present study, we aim to investigate the effect of difference in flapping phase between fore and hind wings towards their aerodynamic performances. We computationally simulate incompressible, viscous, laminar flow around two thin flat airfoils that are purely plunging, at a Strouhal number of 0.25 and Reynolds number of 6500, using a flow solver in an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian framework. Kinematics of both fore and hind wing flapping followed a similar sinusoidal function but with relative phase angle difference to each other, that were varied between -50° to +50° including two cases were phase difference is 0° (i.e. in-phase fore-hind wing flapping) and +90° (i.e. fore wing lags hind wing by 90°). Numerical results indicate that maximum lift and drag forces for each fore and hind wings occur at phase angle of -40° and that power efficiency of tandem wings are better at phase angles when hind wing leads the fore wing, with maximum power efficiency occurring at a fore-hind wing phase difference of +30°. The complex fore-hind wing vortex interaction indicate likely benefit on the hind wing as it interacts with the fore wing at different phase angles. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The topic of natural fiber is one of the most active areas in thermoset composite research today. This paper will focuses on the effect of weave designs on the mechanical behaviour of lamina intraply hybrid composites. Twelve specimens were used and they were made of kenaf fibre and glass fibre as a reinforcement and unsaturated polyester resin as a matrix in various weave designs which were plain, twill, satin, basket, mock leno, and leno weave. Vacuum infusion technique was used due to its superior advantages over hand lay-up. The specimens were produced in two types which were kenaf fibre in warp direction interlace with glass fibre in weft direction (WK-WG) and glass fibre in warp direction interlace with kenaf fibre in weft direction (WG-WK). Various weave designs were found to affect the tensile properties. Glass fibre in warp direction has a greater effect on tensile strength compared to kenaf fibre in warp direction. Mock leno weave exhibited better mechanical properties for WK-WG and WG-WK, about 54.74 MPa and 99.46 MPa respectively. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'There are many technologies about exhaust emissions reduction for wide variety of spark ignition (SI) engine have been considered as the improvement throughout the combustion process. The stricter on legislation of emission and demands of lower fuel consumption needs to be priority in order to satisfy the demand of emission quality. Besides, alternative fuel such as methanol-gasoline blends is used as working fluid in this study due to its higher octane number and self-sustain concept which capable to contribute positive effect to the combustion process. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of methanol-gasoline fuel with different blending ratio and variant ambient pressures on flame development and emission for gasoline engine. An experimental study is carried towards to the flame development of methanol-gasoline fuel in a constant volume chamber. Schlieren optical visualization technique is a visual process that used when high sensitivity is required to photograph the flow of fluids of varying density used for captured the combustion images in the constant volume chamber and analysed through image processing technique. Apart from that, the result showed combustion burn rate increased when the percentage of methanol content in gasoline increased. Thus, high percentage of methanol-gasoline blends gave greater flame development area. Moreover, the emissions of CO, NOX and HC are performed a reduction when the percentage of methanol content in gasoline is increased. Contrarily, the emission of Carbon dioxide, CO2 is increased due to the combustion process is enhanced. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Algae oil methyl esters produced from algae oil were blended with diesel at various volumetric percentages to evaluate the variations in the fuel properties. Microalgae biodiesel production has received much interest in an effort for sustainable development as the microalgae seem to be an attractive way to produce the biodiesel due to their ability to accumulate lipids and their very high actual photosynthetic yields. Correlations between fuel properties, including the calorific heat, density, kinematic viscosity, and oxidation stability of the Algae oil-diesel blends, and the blending ratio of the algae biodiesel have been established. As a result, low blending ratio of the Algae oil with diesel was recommended up to 2vol % in comparison with other type of biodiesel-diesel blends. The objective of this research is to investigate effect of biodiesel blending ratio on ignition delay, combustion process and emission for different type of biodiesel. The combustion tests of the Algae-Derived biodiesel blends were performed in a Rapid Compression Machine (RCM). The combustion tests were carried out at injection pressure of 130 MPa and ambient temperature were varied between 750 K and 1100 K. The result from the experiment is compared with Palm-Oil biodiesel which are varied in biodiesel percentage from 5vol% to 15vol% and jatropha biodiesel. Higher ignition delay period were clearly observed with higher blending ratio. It seems that increasing blending ratio exhibits relatively weakens in fuel ignitibility and therefore prolongs the ignition delay of algae biodiesel. A2 had the lowest ignition delay period when compared with J2, B5, B10 and B15 due to lower density that present in A2 molecules.The concentration of carbon dioxide and nitrogen monoxide in the exhaust gas increased with higher blending ratio while the concentration of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon decreased. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"Marine clay is found widely along the coastal area and had caused expensive solutions in the construction of coastal highways. Hence, soil stabilization was suggested by some consultant to increase the strength of this soil in order to meet the highway construction requirement and also to achieve the specification for the development. Biomass Silica (BS), particularly the SH85 as a non-traditional stabilisation method, has been gaining more interest from the engineers recently. Rubber chips (RC), derived from waste rubber tyres, are considered 'green' element and had been used previously in some geotechnical engineering works. This paper presents the effect of using BS and RC as a mixture (BS-RC mixture), to increase the strength of marine clay for highway construction. Samples of marine clay, obtained from the West Coast Expressway project at Teluk Intan, Perak, were oven dried and grind to fine-grained sized. The marine clay was mixed with 9 % by weight proportion of BS- RC that were 8%-l% and 7%-2%, respectively. For comparison purposes the result of BS-RC was compared to the result of stabilization by using 9% BS only. Laboratory tests were then carried out to determine the Atterberg limits and compaction characteristics of the untreated and treated marine clay. The Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) of the untreated and treated marine clays, compacted at the optimum moisture content was later obtained. The treated marine clay was tested at 0, 3 and 7 days curing periods. The results show that the Plasticity Index of BS-RC treated marine clay was lower than the untreated marine clay. From the UCS test results, it is shown that BS-RC mixtures had significantly improved the strength of marine clay. With the same percentage of 9% BS-RC, the increased of BS from 7% to 8% increased the UCS further to about six times more than untreated marine clay soils in 7 days curing period. The strength gained by using BS-RC at 8%-1% is slightly below the strength by using 9% BS only. From the experimental results, it is shown that BS, in the form of SH85, admixed with rubber chips could significantly improve the strength of marine clay soils. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'Cloud computing is a new paradigm shift in information technology.

Different extrusion rates at two different rheology properties were introduced on a straight and conical spinneret resulting in various shear rates. The hollow fiber membrane precursors were spun using the wet spinning method to decouple the effect of shear and elongation stress due to gravity stretched drawing. The morphology of the spun hollow fiber was observed under Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and the overall porosity were measured using mercury intrusion porosimeter. Shear rate and apparent viscosity at the tip of the spinneret annulus were simulated using a computational fluid dynamics package solidworks floworks. Simulation data shows that extrusion rate increment increases the shear rate at the spinneret wall which in turn reduce the apparent viscosity consistent with a non Newtonian shear thinning fluid behavior. Thus, the outer finger-like region grows as the shear rate increases. Also, overall porosity of hollow fiber membrane decreases with extrusion rate increment which is caused by better molecular orientation resulting in denser hollow fiber membrane. Thin outer finger-like region is achieved at low shear experience of 109.55 s-1 via a straight spinneret. Increasing the extrusion rate thus shear rate will cause outer finger-like region growth which is not desirable in a separation process. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'In this study, the main objective is to determine the percentage difference of part weight between experimental and simulation work.

Electrokinetic-Bioremediation (Ek-Bio) is one of the techniques that can be conducted to remediate contaminated soil. Therefore, the most prominent bacteria from landfill soil will be isolated to determine their optimal conditions for culture and growth. The degradation rate and the effectiveness of selected local bacteria were used to reduce soil contamination. Hence, this enhances microbiological activities to degrade contaminants in soil and reduce the content of heavy metals. The aim of this study is to investigate the ability of isolated bacteria (Lysinibacillus fusiformis) to remove mercury in landfill soil. 5 kg of landfill soil was mixed with deionized water to make it into slurry condition for the purpose of electrokinetic and bioremediation. This remediation technique was conducted for 7 days by using 50 V/m of electrical gradient and Lysinibacillus fusiformis bacteria was applied at the anode reservoir. The slurry landfill soil was located at the middle of the reservoir while distilled water was placed at the cathode of reservoir. After undergoing treatment for 7 days, the mercury analyzer showed that there was a significant reduction of approximately up to 78 % of mercury concentration for the landfill soil. From the results, it is proven that electrokinetic bioremediation technique is able to remove mercury within in a short period of time. Thus, a combination of Lysinibacillus fusiformis and electrokinetic technique has the potential to remove mercury from contaminated soil in Malaysia. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Silicon carbide nanomaterials especially silicon carbide nanowhiskers (SiCNWs) has been known for its excellent properties such as high thermal stability, good chemical inertness and excellent electronic properties.

X-ray diffraction revealed that β-SiC was detected for samples synthesized from blends with ratio of PKS to silica of 5:1 and 7:1. FESEM images also show that SiCNWs with the average diameter of 70 nm were successfully formed from blends with ratio of PKS to silica of 5:1 and 7:1. A vapour-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism was proposed to explain the growth of SiCNWs from blends of PKS and silica. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"Contaminated soil with heavy metals, especially Arsenic (As) has become a major issue worldwide. As is reported to be a metal that affects human health and is related to have caused serious diseases that interrupts the nervous system, blood vessels and kidneys. However, proper treatment techniques such as Stabilization/Solidification (S/S) method can be employed and is capable of controlling these heavy metals from contaminating the soil strata and groundwater resources. This study is to investigate the leachability of Arsenic (As) in S/S method when bagasse ash (BA) is added to remedy contaminated Landfill soil. Cement is added at a proportion of 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% in sample weights without BA while in another sample the cement replaces BA at a proportion of 2.5%, 5%, 7.5%. and 10%. All samples were allowed to harden and cured at room temperature for 7, 14 and 28 days. The effectiveness of the treatment was assessed by conducting Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedure (SPLP). Results indicate that pH and leachability are found to have major influence on metal release. The final pH after leaching tests showed improvements especially samples containing BA. In addition, the concentration of As in the SPLP test after the curing period of 28 days were detected to be below the leachability limit as regulated by WHO's Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality. As a whole, the results obtained from testing showed that sample containing 10% cement with 10% BA is the most effective and is the optimum mix since this proportion succeeded in minimising the leachability of As at total reduction by 100%, In conclusion, partial replacement of cement with BA in the binder system has been successful in reducing the leachability. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'The EU directive 2001/85/EC is an official European text which describes the specifications for \"single deck class II and III vehicles\" required to be approved by the regulation UN/ECE no.66 (R66). To prevent the catastrophic consequences by occupant during an accident, the Malaysian government has reinforced the same regulation upon superstructure construction. This paper discusses collapse mechanism analysis of a superstructure vehicle using a Crash D nonlinear analysis computer program based on this regulation. The analysis starts by hand calculation to define the required energy absorption by the chosen structure. Simple calculations were then performed to define the weakest collapse mechanism after undesirable collapse modes are eliminated. There are few factors highlighted in this work to pass the regulation. Using the selected cross section, Crash D simulation showed a good result. Generally, the deformation is linearly correlates to the energy absorption for the structure with low stiffness. Failure of critical members such as vertical lower side wall must be avoided to sustain safety of the passenger compartment and prevent from severe and fatal injuries to the trapped occupant. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Geo hazard can result in reducing of environmental health and huge economic losses especially in mountainous area.

Noncontact reflectance data are collected from central forehead, posterior forearm, thenar region of palm and proximal ankle of three healthy Asians. The prediction of the required StO2 value is via fitting Extended Modified Lambert (EMLB) model to the measured attenuation data using extinction coefficient of hemoglobin components in the wavelength range of 520 - 600 nm as its priori knowledge. The obtained results revealed a relatively high mean StO2 of 54 ± 1.9% at the palm of the hand site. This is followed by measurement at foot ankle and forehead with StO2 of 52.3 ± 2.4% and 51.2 ± 7.7%, respectively. Meanwhile the lowest reading of StO2 of 48.8 ± 5.1% is observed at the posterior forearm. Based on these findings, this work concluded that palm of the hand would provide considerably consistent measurement of StO2 among individuals. This is largely owing to the higher density of circulatory anastomosis at this skin site. This implied viability of using the developed strategy in the studies of microcirculation mechanism especially on wound at this skin region. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Simple Structural Surfaces (SSS) method is offered as a means of organizing the process for rationalizing the basic vehicle body structure load paths. The application of this simplified approach is highly beneficial in the design development of modern passenger car structure especially during the conceptual stage. In Malaysia, however, there is no real physical model of SSS available to gain considerable insight and understanding into the function of each major subassembly in the whole vehicle structures. Based on this motivation, a physical model of SSS for sedan model with the corresponding model vehicle tests of bending and torsion is proposed in this work. The proposed approach is relatively easy to understand as compared to Finite Element Method (FEM). The results show that the proposed vehicle model test is capable to show that satisfactory load paths can give a sufficient structural stiffness within the vehicle structure. It is clearly observed that the global bending stiffness reduce significantly when more panels are removed from a complete SSS model. It is identified that parcel shelf is an important subassembly to sustain bending load. The results also match with the theoretical hypothesis, as the stiffness of the structure in an open section condition is shown weak when subjected to torsion load compared to bending load. The proposed approach can potentially be integrated with FEM to speed up the design process of automotive vehicle. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The demand for better and efficient road network has increased tremendously due to the rapid development experienced by the nation in the past few decades.

However, biodiesels produce higher nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions compared with diesel. Although water-emulsified fuels can lower NOx emissions by reducing flame temperature, its influence on atomization needs to be investigated further. This study investigates the effects of water on spray formation in air-assisted atomizers. The Schlieren method was used to capture the spray images in terms of tip penetration, spray angle, and spray area. The experiment used palm oil biodiesel at different blending ratios (B5, B10, and B15) and water contents (0vol%-15vol%). Results show that water content in the fuel increases the spray penetration and area but reduces the spray angle because of the changes in fuel properties. Therefore, biodiesel-water application is applicable to burner systems. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"Crime Map is an online web based geographical information system that assists the public and users to visualize crime activities geographically.

The mechanism of the failures is mainly due to the loss of matric suction of soils by rainwater. When rainwater infiltrates into the slopes, it will start to saturate the soil, i.e., reduce the matric suction. A good understanding of landslide mechanisms and the characteristics of unsaturated soil and rock in tropical areas is crucial in landslide hazard formulation. Most of the slope failures in unsaturated tropical residual soil in Malaysia are mainly due to infiltration, especially during intense and prolonged rainfall, which reduces the soil matric suction and hence decreases the stability of the slope. Therefore, the aim of this research is to determine the matric suction for barren soil and to model an unsaturated slope with natural rainfall to evaluate the effects of matric suction on rainfall intensity. A field test was carried out using the Watermark Soil Moisture Sensor to determine the matric suction. The sensor was connected to a program called SpecWare 9 Basic which also used Data Logging Rain gauge Watermark 1120 to measure the intensity and duration of rainfall. This study was conducted at the Research Centre for Soft Soil which is a new Research and Development (R & D) initiative by Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Parit Raja. Field observation showed that the highest daily suction was recorded during noon while the lowest suction was obtained at night and early morning. The highest matric suction for loose condition was 31.0 kPa while the highest matric suction for compacted condition was 32.4 kPa. The results implied that the field suction variation was not only governed by the rainfall, but also the cyclic evaporation process. The findings clearly indicated that the changes in soil suction distribution patterns occurred due to different weather conditions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The determination and identification of slope instability are often rely on data obtained from in-situ soil investigation work where it involves the logistic of machineries and manpower, thus these aspects may increase the cost especially for remote locations.

Reliability of DOA estimation depends on several factors such as the choice of DOA algorithm, size of antenna array as well as array geometry. Therefore, it is particularly desirable to have a configuration of antenna array that could produce an accurate azimuth estimation. In this work, a new planar array is proposed to address the problem of azimuth estimation. This is achieved by having a flexible element position on the x- y plane that improves the steering vector, hence significantly enhances the accuracy of DOA estimation. Besides, a fair distribution of the antenna elements on the x-y plane also helps to eliminates estimation failure in the azimuth range between 240° and 360°. A comparison study between the proposed array and V-shape array is performed in order to gauge the performance of the proposed array in DOA estimation. Simulation results show that the proposed array has acquired better estimation resolution than V-shape array. On top of that, the proposed array has reduced estimation error in V-shape array.

This paper presents an analysis of DOA estimation with mutual coupling compensation using a linear antenna array. Mutual coupling effect is represented by mutual coupling coefficients and taken into account when calculating the array output. The mutual coupling compensation technique exploits a banded mutual coupling matrix to reduce the computational complexity. The banded matrix reflects the relationship between mutual coupling effect and the element spacing in an antenna array. The analysis is being carried out using the Capon algorithm, one of spectral-based DOA algorithms, for estimating the DOA of incoming signals. Computer simulations are performed to show the performance of the mutual coupling compensation technique on DOA estimation. Simulation results show that, in term of estimation resolution, the mutual coupling compensation technique manages to obtain a comparable results compared to the case without mutual coupling consideration. However, the mutual coupling compensation technique produces significant estimation error compared to the case without mutual coupling. The study concludes that the banded matrix of mutual coupling coefficients should be properly designed to improve the performance of mutual coupling compensation technique in DOA estimation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Microtissue can be grown on soft substrates of hydrogel or liquid crystal gel.

Few experiments were conducted in a rapid compression machine (RCM). Four types of fuels were tested inside a RCM which are standard diesel (SD), Algae biodiesel (A2), Palm Oil biodiesel (B5, B10, and B15) and Jatropha biodiesel (J5, J10, J15). The experiments were conducted at high injection pressure of 130 MPa. The ambient temperature of constant volume chamber at the time of fuel injection was set at 850 K. The results indicate that the combined factors of specific of ambient temperature and higher injection pressure produces shorter ignition delay time. B5 has the shortest ignition delay with 1.5 ms. Biodiesel has the shorter ignition delay which is prolonged with increasing biodiesel content in the blends. In terms of emissions, Carbon dioxide (CO2), Carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC) and smoke emissions decreased with all biodiesel-diesel blends. However, oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emission of the biodiesel was relatively higher than those of the diesel under all test conditions. In addition, the increase of blends in terms of biodiesel ratio was found to be significant in enhancing the combustion process. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The influence of the leaching temperatures on the solvent debinding process of SS316L stainless steel alloy compact has been investigated.

Currently, many researches are focusing on improving the aerodynamic performance of wind turbine blades through simulations and wind tunnel testing. In the present study, the aerodynamic performance of the perforated Eqwin blade (shell type blade) is investigated by using numerical simulation. Three types of slots namely circular, horizontal rectangular and vertical rectangular were evaluated. It was found that the optimum angle of attack for a perforated shell type blade was 12° with maximum Cl/Cd value of 6.420. In general, for all the perforated blade cases, Cl/Cd tended to decrease as the slot size increased except for the circular slot with 5 mm diameter. This was due to the disturbance of the airflow in lower side region which passed through the bigger slot size. Among the modified slots the circular slot with diameter of 5 mm would be the best slot configuration that can be considered for blade fabrication. The Cl/Cd obtained was 6.46 which is about 5% more than the value of the reference blade. Moreover, the introduced slot would also reduce the overall weight of the blade by 1.3%. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The effect of alcohol addition has been experimentally in vestgated in the current study by blending it with diesel and palm based biodiesel on the combustion of a compression ignition engine. The experiment was run by single-cylinder, naturally aspirated, direct injection, four-stroke diesel engine. Based on the pressure-crank angle data collected from the pressure transducer and crank angle encoder, the combustion analysis such as incylinder pressure, incylinder temperature, energy release rate, cumulative energy release and ignition delay are analysed. In this comparative study, the effects of alcohols namely butanol BU20 (20% butanol addition on the commercially available diesel biodiesel emulsion) is compared and evaluated with pure diesel (D100). The results revealed that the the ignition delay for BU20 is longer as compared to that of D100 in all engine speeds and loads compared. Besides, the incylinder temperatures were rudecued with the butanol addition. The energy release rate for BU20 was higher than that for diesel, whereas the peak positions concerning the energy release rate for BU20 was discovered at 2400 rpm. Therefore addition of butanol will have positive role on the NOx emissions and stability of the engine due to its higher latent heat of vaporization. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"Developing software through Global Software Development (GSD) became very common now days in the software industry.

This phenomenon is called thermophoresis, which influences the movement of soot particles in exhaust gas from combustors. It is important to understand the behavior of soot particles in the combustion field for emission control. The main problem for measuring the thermophoretic velocity is the natural convection. The velocity of such natural convection is usually comparable to the thermophoretic velocity and cannot be measured directly. To avoid this problem, experiments should be conducted under microgravity conditions. . In the present work, device has been developed for conducting experiments repeatedly under a microgravity environment in a very short period time, i.e. 0.3 s, by means of the free-fall method, to accumulate data of the thermophoretic velocity. Experiments have been conducted to measure the movement of particles in the microgravity environment with and without temperature gradient. For the former experiment, it is seen that the particles has almost no movement in the horizontal and the vertical directions. Results confirmed that there is negligible effect of blowing and gravitational on the particles movement. For the later one, experiments have been done in a surrounding of a pure gas of argon. The thermophoretic velocity is measured at 313±2 K for various pressure conditions from 20 kPa to 100 kPa. The thermophoretic velocity for each particle is individually measured, and the mean value and its 95% confidence interval for each experimental condition are statistically obtained.

In this paper, a new integrated design concept evaluation based on fuzzy-technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (Fuzzy-TOPSIS) is presented, and it also attempts to incorporate sustainability practices in assessing the criteria. Prior to Fuzzy-TOPSIS, a new scale of \"Weighting criteria\" for survey process is developed to quantify the evaluation criteria. This method will help engineers to improve the effectiveness and objectivity of the sustainable product development. Case example from industry is presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology. The result of the example shows that the new integrated method provides an alternative to existing methods of design concept evaluation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The electricity consumption nowadays has increased due to the increasing development of portable electronic devices.

Thus far, high-altitude aerosol sampling has been conducted mostly using manned flights, which requires enormous financial and logistical resources. There had been researches for the utilisation of high altitude balloon (HAB) for active and passive aerosol samplings within the stratosphere. However, the gathered samples in the payload were either brought down by controlling the balloon air pressure or were just dropped with a parachute to slow the descend speed in order to reduce the impact upon landing. In most cases, the drop location of the sample are unfavorable such as in the middle of the sea, dense foliage, etc. Hence a system that can actively sample aerosols at high-altitude and improve the delivery method in terms of quality and reliability using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is designed and tested in this study. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'This paper presents a non-linear finite element analysis (FEA) method to predict the spring-back deformation for composite structures manufactured using autoclave processing. It is a progression from previous accompanying study on flat unidirectional samples and the aim is to observe spring-back warpage on laminates consisting of angled (±45°) plies compared to unidirectional (0°) laminate. Three samples for each of the symmetrical laminates with angled plies [45/0]S and [45/-45]S are manufactured and the warpage form is observed.

Laser transmitter was utilized to project high contrast tracking spot for depth calculation using common triangulation. Stereo vision algorithm was developed to acquire the distance from tracked point to QUAV and the control algorithm was designed to manipulate QUAV's response based on depth calculated. Attitude and position controller were designed using the non-linear model with the help of Optitrack motion tracking system. A number of collision avoidance flight tests were carried out to validate the performance of the stereo vision and control algorithm based on image sensors. In the results, the UAV was able to hover with fairly good accuracy in both static and dynamic collision avoidance for short range collision avoidance. Collision avoidance performance of the UAV was better with obstacle of dull surfaces in comparison to shiny surfaces. The minimum collision avoidance distance achievable was 0.4 m.

The nanoparticle volume fraction and Reynolds number considered are in the range of 0-1% and 100-1500, respectively. Numerical solutions are obtained by using finite difference method to solve the governing equations. The effects of the volume fraction of nanoparticle, triangular facing-step channel amplitude height, wavelength and Reynolds number on local skin-friction coefficient, average Nusselt number and enhancement of heat transfer are presented and discussed. The results show that the Nusselt number and friction coefficient increases as the amplitude height of triangle channel increases. As the nanoparticle volume fraction increases, the Nusselt number is also found to be significantly increased, accompanied by only a slight increase in the friction coefficient. In addition, it is found that the heat transfer enhancement mainly depends on the amplitude height of the triangle wall, nanoparticle volume fraction and Reynolds number rather than the wavelength. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Experimental investigations were carried out to study the effect of varying multiple jet impingement plate configurations on Reynolds Number (Re) in a closed conduit. Air was considered as the working fluid. There were six multiple impingement plates used for this experiment where each plate has a different hole configurations that include the hole diameter, hole orientation, pitch in x-direction and pitch in y-direction. Four sets of orifice plate with diameter of 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.05 m were used to get the mass flow rate in the pipe. Air was sucked through the impingement plate for five different settings of suction fan with an interval of 10Hz from 10 to 50Hz. By taking the data for constant suction fan setting at 50Hz, it was found that the impingement hole orientation for both in-line and staggered does not give any effect on the Re obtained since the differences was considerably small and fell within the accepted errors. Meanwhile, impingement hole diameter was found to be directly proportional with the Re obtained. It was also found that the different pitch in multiple hole impingement plate resulted in changes of Re. The results show that the Re was decreasing with higher pitch.

Natural fiber is one of the potential materials to be used with thermoplastic as a composite due to its attractive properties such as lightweight and strong. In this paper, flammability properties of this material are evaluated through Underwriters Laboratory 94 Horizontal Burning (UL94 HB), which has been conducted for both controlled and uncontrolled conditions, smoke density and limiting oxygen index tests (LOI). These flammability tests are in compliance with the Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) requirement. The results from UL94 HB and smoke density tests show that the presence of nanoclays with effective composition of kenaf fiber reinforced ABS has enhanced the burning characteristics of the material by hindering propagation of flame spread over the surface of the material through char formation. Consequently, this decreases the burning rate and produces low amount of smoke during burning. On contrary, through LOI test, this material requires less oxygen to burn when exposed to fire, which hinders the enhancement of burning characteristics. This is due to burning mechanism exhibited by nanoclays that catalyzes barrier formation and flame propagation rate over the surface of the biocomposite material. Overall, these experimental results suggest that this biocomposite material is capable of self-extinguishing and possesses effective fire extinction. The observed novel synergism from the result obtained is promising to be implemented in secondary structures of aircraft with significant benefits such as cost-effective, lightweight and biodegradable self-extinguishing biocomposite. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"Venturi tube plays a very important role in different fields of engineering.

They have found wide applications in aerospace as part of the primary structures, as well as the interior paneling and floors. High performance aluminum and aramid are the typical materials used for the purpose of honeycomb core whereas in other industries, materials such as fibre glass, carbon fibre, Nomex and also Kevlar reinforced with polymer are used. Recently, growing interest in developing composite structures with natural fibre reinforcement has also spurred research in natural fibre honeycomb material. The majority of the researches done, however, have generally emphasized on the usage of random chopped fibre and only a few are reported on development of honeycomb structure using unidirectional fibre as the reinforcement. This is mainly due to its processing difficulties, which often involve several stages to account for the arrangement of fibres and curing. Since the use of unidirectional fibre supports greater strength compared to random chopped fibre, a single-stage process in conjunction with vacuum infusion is suggested with a mould design that supports fibre arrangement in the direction of honeycomb loading. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'In this work, two different processing techniques were approached to identify the properties of the multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) reinforced polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS).

The tail is incorporated into a new design of blended wing body (BWB) aircraft, known as Baseline-V, located just aft of the trailing edge of its inboard wing. The proposed close-coupled tail is equipped with elevators that deflect in unison, and can tilt - an unusual means of tilting where if starboard side is tilted downward at k degree, and then the portside must be tilted upward at k degree too. A wind tunnel experiment is conducted to investigate aerodynamics and static stability of Baseline-V BWB aircraft. The model is being tested at actual flight speed of 15 m/s (54 km/h) with varying angle of attack for five elevator angle cases at zero tilt angle and varying sideslip angle for four tilt angle cases at one fixed elevator angle.

Ti-6Al-4V of 1 mm and 3 mm thickness were used as the workpiece substrate. The principal findings are mainly based on minimising the taper angle in laser drilled holes, reducing the heat affected zone and reducing the production of spatter. Identification of key process variables associated with laser drilling process is accomplished by trial experimentation. Using the identified key process variables, further experiments were then performed with the assistance of statistical design of experiment (DOE) to find the interaction and individual effects of various laser process parameters on laser drilled hole quality. The lowest taper angle of 1.8 degrees was achieved with use of nitrogen as the assist gas. Furthermore, from the laser process observations, it was found that laser power significantly affects the quality of the laser drilled hole. Increase in laser power would increase the hole size and result in more spatter on the entry hole surfaces. The nozzle focus position substantially influenced the laser drilled hole size. The amount of spatter deposits increased with decrease in the nozzle offset. Increase in laser frequency significantly increased the exit diameter, which resulted in smaller taper angle. Number of pulse required to drill through a workpiece depends on the material properties and physical properties of the material. For 1mm Ti-6Al-4V, a minimum of two pulses was required to successfully removed the material during drilling and a minimum of 4 pulses was required to drill through the same material with 3mm thickness. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'In the present days, the utilization of palmyra fiber in automotive and aerospace applications has increased drastically due to its high strength and low weight.

Pitting corrosion was identified as a major cause of the shaft failure and this study was conducted to improve the corrosion resistance on the AISI 4140 alloy steel shaft by gas nitriding as a surface hardening treatment. Gas nitriding was performed with composition of 15% ammonia and 85% nitrogen at temperatures of 525 °C, 550 °C and 575 °C and with the soaking time of 30, 45 and 60 minutes, respectively.

Phase 3 was test and analysis whereby a PINENG-PN968s-10000mAh Power Bank's 5 volts, which was reduced to 2.5 volts using LM2596 Step-Down Converter, powered and activated the NiTi spring inside each actuator. The bias spring (compression type), which functions to protract and push the blades to spread position, will compress together with the retraction of actuators and pull the blades to the folding position. Once the power was removed and SMA spring deactivated, the bias spring stiffness will extend the SMA spring and casing and push the blades back to spread position. The timing for the whole revolution was recorded. Based on the experimental analysis, the recorded timing for folding sequence is 2.5 minutes in average and therefore met the required criteria. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'This paper deals with the optimization of a synthetic jet actuator parameters in the control flow around the NACA0015 airfoil at two angles of attack: 13° (i.e. the stall angle of NACA0015) and 16° (i.e. the post stall angle of NACA0015) to maximize the aerodynamic performance of the airfoil. Synthetic jet actuator is a zero mass flux-active flow control device that alternately injects and removes fluid through a small slot at the input movement frequency of a diaphragm. The movement of the diaphragm and also the external flow around the airfoil were simulated using numerical approach. The objective of the optimization process function was maximum lift-drag ratio (L/D) and the optimization variables were jet frequency, length of the jet slot and jet location along the chord. The power coefficient of the jet was considered as a constraint. The response surface optimization method was employed to achieve the optimal parameters. The results showed that the actuator is more effective for post stall angles of attack that can lead to an enhancement of 66% in L/D. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Due to energy shortage and global warming, issues of energy saving have become more important. To increase the energy efficiency and reduce the fuel consumption, waste heat recovery is a significant method for energy saving. The organic Rankine cycle (ORC) has great potential to recover the waste heat from the core jet exhaust of a turbofan engine and use it to produce power. Preliminary study of the design concept and thermodynamic performance of this ORC system would assist researchers to predict the benefits of using the ORC system to extract the exhaust heat engine. In addition, a mathematical model of the heat transfer of this ORC system is studied and developed. The results show that with the increment of exhaust heat temperature, the mass flow rate of the working fluid, net power output and the system thermal efficiency will also increase. Consequently, total consumption of jet fuel could be significantly saved as well. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Since Tarokh discovered Space-Time Trellis Code (STTC) in 1998, a considerable effort has been done to improve the performance of the original STTC. One way of achieving enhancement is by focusing on the generator matrix G, which represents the encoder structure for STTC. Until now, researchers have only concentrated on STTCs of different states in analyzing the performance of generator matrix G. No effort has been made on different generator matrices G of similar state. The reason being, it is difficult to produce a wide variety of generator matrices G with diverse minimum determinants. In this paper a number of generator matrices G with minimum determinant of four (4), eight (8) and sixteen (16) of the same state (i.e., 4-PSK) have been successfully produced. The performance of different generator matrices G in term of their bit error rate and signal-to-noise ratio for a Rayleigh fading environment are compared and evaluated. It is found from the MATLAB simulation that at low SNR (<8), the BER of generator matrices G with smaller minimum determinant is comparatively lower than those of higher minimum determinant. However, at high SNR (>14) there is no significant difference between the BER of these generator matrices G. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'This paper describes the setup of a precise thrust stand based on torsional pendulum design for characterizing the performance of microthrusters.

Although aerogels possess fascinating physical properties, innovative solutions to tackle today's problems were limited due to their relative high manufacturing cost in comparison to conventional materials. Recently, some producers have brought forward quality aerogels at competitive costs, and thereby opening a panoply of applied research in this field. In this paper, the feasibility of spray-drying silica aerogel to tailor its granulometric property is studied for thermal spraying, a novel application of aerogels that is never tried before in the academic arena.

The plate is assumed to fulfil the plain strain condition and it is axially stressed. According to the literature, the SIFs of the cracks in circular notches are available. However, the roles of cracks in large groove are difficult to obtain. Therefore, different grooves and crack geometries are modelled numerically using the ANSYS finite element software. The present model is first validated using an existing model of double edge cracks without notches and it is found that both models are in close agreement. The large grooves are then introduced and the cracks are positioned in the mid-point. It is found numerically that the SIFs are strongly affected by the relative crack depth and the groove geometries. It is also found that the large groove is capable of reducing the SIFs in comparison with the circular notched due to lower stress concentration factors. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'This paper presents the experimental results from the investigation carried out at the UTM Low Speed wind tunnel facility (UTM-LST) on a half model generic transport aircraft at several configurations of primary control surfaces (flap, aileron and elevator).

The riblets are arranged in directionally converging - diverging pattern with dimensions of height, h = 1 mm, pitch or spacing, s = 1 mm, yaw angle α = 0° and 10° The airfoil with external geometry of 500 mm span, 600 mm chord and 156 mm thickness has been built using mostly woods and aluminium. Turbulence quantities are collected using hotwire anemometry. Hotwire measurements show that flows past converging and diverging pattern inherit similar patterns in the near-wall region for both mean velocity and turbulence intensities profiles. The mean velocity profiles in logarithmic regions for both flows past converging and diverging riblet pattern are lower than that with yaw angle α = 0°. Converging riblets cause the boundary layer to thicken and the flow with yaw angle α = 0° produces the thinnest boundary layer. Both the converging and diverging riblets cause pronounced outer peaks in the turbulence intensities profiles. Most importantly, flows past converging and diverging pattern experience 30% skin friction reductions. Higher order statistics show that riblet surfaces produce similar effects due to adverse pressure gradient. It is concluded that a small strip of different ordered roughness features applied at a leading edge of an airfoil can change the turbulence characteristics dramatically. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"CubeSats enable low-cost experiment and missions to be performed by universities and research institution in space.

The aim is to prove that surface roughness can be used as a simple and inexpensive method to achieve better flight performance such as enhanced thrust and/or reduced power requirement. The research was done experimentally, using scaled model of Eurocopter AS350 Ecureuil. Smooth profile of the main rotor blade was modified by applying surface roughness on the upper and lower camber in transition and turbulent boundary layer region, starting from 25% of chord length and extending up to the trailing edge (TE). This study was conducted with the conditions of a vertical flight (particularly in hover condition) since this is a high powerconsuming flight regime for helicopter. The experiment resulted in lower power requirement but at the expense of reduced thrust at the middle collective pitch level. At upper range of the collective pitch level, surface roughness was seen to delay the stall angle as well as increase the lift in the stall region. Meanwhile, at lower pitch level, there was an increase in thrust-to-power ratio. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Development of bio-sourced materials over the recent years has shown growing interests due to their eco-friendly characteristics.

The focus of the paper is to make use of the kinematics parameters and EMG readings of skeletal system to predict the individual torque of upper extremity's joints. The surface EMG signals are fed into different mathematical models so that these data can be trained through Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find the best correlation between EMG signals and torques acting on the upper limb's joints. The estimated torque attained from the mathematical models is called simulated output. The simulated output will then be compared with the actual individual joint which is calculated based on the real time kinematics parameters of the upper movement of the skeleton when the muscle cells are activated.

This is a challenge for the control and design of the volumetric composition and microstructural uniformity of such composites. In the present study, a model is presented for the prediction of the complete volumetric composition (i.e. volume fractions of fibres, matrix and porosity) in hybrid fibre composites. The model is based on a constant local fibre volume fraction criterion. Good agreement is found between model predictions and experimental data of pultruded hybrid kenaf/glass fibre composites with variable hybrid fibre weight mixing ratios. To demonstrate the suitability of the model, simulations are performed for four different cases of volumetric composition in hybrid kenaf/glass composites. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Durian rind cellulose reinforced poly(lactic acid) (PLA) biocomposites were prepared using Brabender internal mixer followed by hot compression molding technique. Cellulose was previously treated by 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane for improving the compatibility with PLA matrix. The silane-grafting of cellulose was confirmed via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) with the presence of Si-O-Si, Si-C, and Si-O-C bonds. The silane-treated cellulose was subsequently introduced into PLA matrix, and the effects of cellulose surface modification on mechanical, thermal and morphological properties, and water absorption of biocomposites were studied. It was found that silane-treated cellulose reinforced biocompositeshave superior mechanical properties compared with untreated cellulose reinforced biocomposites. The lowest crystallization temperature of silane-treated biocomposites was confirmed via Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigation also showed that adhesion of cellulose and PLA matrix was improved by modification of cellulosesurfaceusing3-aminopropyltriethoxysilanewhich can result in less water absorption into biocomposites. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'This study explores the feasibility of Bacillus subtilis and optimum reagents concentration used in Microbial-Induced Calcite Precipitation (MICP) treatment of tropical residual soil. Experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of cementation reagents concentration toward MICP treatment. The performance of MICP treatment was assessed by measurement of the soil shear strength and calcite content. Based on the experimental results, it is discovered that the cementation reagent concentration has significantly affected on the performance of MICP treatment. The results suggested that the most preferable MICP treatment reagents concentration is 0.25M with the presence of Bacillus subtilis using these treatment parameters, both UCS value and calcite content of treated soil had increased about 38% and 65.6% respectively. However, the reduction in UCS value was manifested for those samples treated at higher reagents concentration (0.35M) this phenomenon is attributed to the salinity of reagents where high salinity is not favourable to the bacteria growth and microbial activity subsequently, this resulted in a consequential decrease in shear strength of the treated soil. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'KerachutBeach is a beautiful beach in Penang National Park (PNP). However this beach is categorisedas one of dangerous beach for swimming activities in Malaysia due to the drowning incidents reported almost every year. The steep beach slope and rip current were among the factors that lead to this incident. Using bathymetry profile, current, tidal and sediment data collected at site incorporated with UKMO wave data analysis,the hydrodynamic pattern was simulated using Mike 21 modelling software. Result from the model showed the evidence of rip current existence along the coastline. It showed that this rip current eventsoccurred during spring tide phase when the flow change from Flood to Ebb. During this period, the current tend to move parallel to the shoreline with maximum speed of 0.3m/s which is capable to swipe away a swimmer. The bathymetry profile at Kerachutis very steep and dangerous to swimmers since there is a 4 meter sudden plunge just meters away from the shoreline. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"Short Piled Raft is a modified piled raft foundation system, which represents combination between raft foundation and pile foundation, but the length of pile is relatively shorter. The basic concept of the Short Piled Raft foundation system considers the passive soil pressure creating a stiff condition of slab-pile system. This means that the thin concrete slab floats on the supporting soil, while the piles serve as stiffeners concrete slab and also to reduce settlement of the foundation. Slab to pile ratio of such system has been mentioned by several researchers, however the optimum pile spacing of stability performance for obtaining minimum settlement on peat haven't been clearly discussed. In this study, finite element method to simulate the stability performance related to settlement of Short Piled Raft foundation system was used. Short Piled Raft foundation system with concrete slab of 7.0 m x 7.0 m square was assumed to be built on peat with the thickness of 3.5 m. The material properties of pile and raft were constant. The outer diameter of galvanized steel pipe as pile was 0.30 m raft thickness was considered to be constant of 0.15 m and the length of pile was 3.0 m, while the pile spacing varied from 0.50 to 3.00 m. Point load varied from 0 to 100 kN with increment of 20 kN was also considered as a static load, acted on the centre of the concrete slab. Optimization was done by comparing each numerical result of simulations, thus conclusion can easily be drawn. The optimum pile spacing was 1.00 m which produced minimum settlement of 30.11 mm under the load of 100 kN. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'A multi-dimensional hydrodynamic and transport model has been used to develop the hydrodynamic and salinity intrusion model for Selangor River Estuary.

In general, stiffer foundations resulted in higher natural frequencies of the building-soil system and higher input frequencies are often associated with other ground. Usually, vibrations transmitted to the buildings by ground borne are often noticeable and can be felt. It might affect the building and become worse if the vibration level is not controlled. UTHM building is prone to the ground borne vibration due to closed distance from the main road, and the construction activities adjacent to the buildings. This paper investigates the natural frequency and vibration mode of multi storey office building with the presence of foundation system and comparison between both systems. Finite element modelling (FEM) package software of LUSAS is used to perform the vibration analysis of the building. The building is modelled based on the original plan with the foundation system on the structure model. The FEM results indicated that the structure which modelled with rigid base have high natural frequency compare to the structure with foundation system. These maybe due to soil structure interaction and also the damping of the system which related to the amount of energy dissipated through the foundation soil. Thus, this paper suggested that modelling with soil is necessary to demonstrate the soil influence towards vibration response to the structure. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The reinforcement used in soil for construction of roads on the soft clay is very important as it will determine the level of service of the road after it was built.

Meanwhile, borehole intrusive technique identifies the changes of soil layer based on soil penetration resistance, i.e. standard penetration test-number of blows (SPT-N). Researchers across the world introduced many empirical conversions of standard penetration test blow number of borehole data to shear wave velocity or vice versa. This is because geophysics test is a non-destructive and relatively fast assessment, and thus should be promoted to compliment the site investigation work. These empirical conversions of shear wave velocity to SPT-N blow can be utilised, and thus suitable geotechnical parameters for design purposes can be achieved. This study has demonstrated the conversion between MASW and SPT-N value. The study was conducted at the university campus and Sejagung Sri Medan. The MASW seismic profiles at the University campus test site and Sejagung were at a depth of 21 m and 13 m, respectively. The shear wave velocities were also calculated empirically using SPT-N value, and thus both calculated and measured shear wave velocities were compared. It is essential to note that the MASW test and empirical conversion always underestimate the actual shear wave velocity of hard layer or rock due to the effect of soil properties on the upper layer. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'This paper opens with an overview of the debatable definition of soft soil that goes beyond a (CH) organic / inorganic clay and OH peat to include weakly cemented periglacial deposits of loess and alike.

Micromechanics of soils recognize that the micro structure and mineralogy of clay have a significant influence on its engineering behaviour. To achieve a more reliable quantitative evaluation of clay mineralogy, a proper sample preparation technique for quantitative clay mineral analysis is necessary. This paper presents the quantitative evaluation of elemental analysis and chemical characterization of oriented and random oriented clay particles using X-ray spectroscopy. Three different types of clays namely marine clay, bentonite and kaolin clay were studied. The oriented samples were prepared by placing the dispersed clay in water and left to settle on porous ceramic tiles by applying a relatively weak suction through a vacuum pump. Images form a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was also used to show the comparison between the orientation patterns of both the sample preparation techniques. From the quantitative analysis of the X-ray spectroscopy, oriented sampling method showed more accuracy in identifying mineral deposits, because it produced better peak intensity on the spectrum and more mineral content can be identified compared to randomly oriented samples. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Soil contamination with heavy metals poses major environmental and human health problems.

During this process, the anode reservoir was filled with Pseudomonas putida while the cathode was filled with distilled water for 5 days at 50 V of electrical gradient. The X-Ray Fluorescent (XRF) test indicated that there was a significant reduction of zinc concentration for the soil near the anode with 89% percentage removal. The bacteria count is high near the anode which is 1.3x107 cfu/gww whereas the bacteria count at the middle and near the cathode was 5.0x106 cfu/gww and 8.0x106 cfu/gww respectively. The migration of ions to the opposite charge of electrodes during the electrokinetic process resulted from the reduction of zinc.

Fibreglass samples in the thickness of 1 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm and 4 mm were developed 100 mm x 300 mm pieces. It was found that 3 mm fibreglass exhibited the maximum tensile load (MTL) and maximum tensile stress (MTS) greater than other samples. Statistical analysis on 3 mm fibreglass indicated that in the approximately equal MTL fibreglass samples experienced 2% while tyre samples experienced 33.9% ultimate tensile strain (UTST) respectively.

This paper investigates the variations of roughness coefficients with the flow depth of grassed swales in the campus of UTHM. Fieldwork was carried out on the grassed swale to collect the hydraulic data, which including the levelling work, measuring the flow depth and flow velocity of the swale. The flow depth of swale was taken at three points divided along the width of swale and the flow velocity is captured three times at each of the point. The variations of roughness coefficients of grassed swales are presented in Manning's equation, and the results reveal that the n value increases with the increasing of flow depth. Manning's coefficient value found in this study is in the range of 0.110 to 0.756, which are higher than the value proposed by the Urban Stormwater Management Manual for Malaysia (MSMA). The relationships of flow depth and velocity at each section of the swale are portrayed in graphs, which show that the velocity increases with the decreasing of flow depth. The outcomes of this study can be concluded that the variation of Manning's coefficient value is influenced by the swale profile, flow depth, flow velocity, and as well as the vegetation used in the grassed swale concerned. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'The feasibility of a low cost agricultural waste of spent mushroom farming waste (SMFW) activated carbon for Ni(II) removal was investigated.

Soil organic matter of peat soil was affected by the environmental, weather, types of vegetative. Peat soil was normally classified based on its level of humification. Humification can be defined as the transformation of numerous group of substances (proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, etc.) and individual molecules present in living organic matter into group of substances with similar properties (humic substances). During the peat transformation process, content of soil organic matter also will change. Hence, that is important to determine out the types of the organic compound. FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared) is a machine which is used to differential soil organic matter by using infrared. Infrared is a types of low energy which can determine the organic minerals. Hence, FTIR can be suitable as an indicator on its level of humification. The main objective of this study is to identify an optimized method to characterization of the soil organic content in different level of humification. The case study areas which had been chosen for this study are Parit Sulong, Batu Pahat and UCTS, Sibu. Peat soil samples were taken by every 0.5 m depth until it reached the clay layer. However, the soil organic matter in different humification levels is not significant. FTIR is an indicator which is used to determine the types of soil, but it is unable to differentiate the soil organic matter in peat soil FTIR can determine different types of the soil based on different wave length. Generally, soil organic matter was found that it is not significant to the level of humification. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'There are several factors that affecting the shear strength and shear strength parameters (i.e. cohesion and friction angle).

However, when comes to road maintenance especially on operated expressways, not all method can be apply directly as it must comply to opreation's working window and lane closure basis. Key factors that considering ideal proposal for ground rehabilitation are time, cost, quality and most importantly practicality. It should provide long lifespan structure in order to reduce continuous cycle of maintenance. Thus, this paper will present two approaches for ground rehabilitation, namely Polyurethane (PU) Foam Injection System and Geocrete Soil Stabilization. The first approach is an injection system which consists two-parts chemical grout of Isocynate and Polyol when mixed together within soil structure through injection will polymerized with volume expansion. The strong expansion of grouting causes significant compression and compacting of the surrounding soil and subsequently improve ground properties and uplift sunken structure. The later is a cold in-place recyclying whereby mixture process that combines in-situ soil materials, cement, white powder (alkaline) additive and water to produce hard yet flexible and durable ground layer that act as solid foundation with improved bearing capacity.

Alkaline activation of soft soil is one of those techniques that has proved to deliver some of the best shear strength values with minor drawbacks in comparison with conventional soil stabilization methods. However, environmental considerations have not been taken into account, as major mineral glassy phase activators are poisoning alkaline solutions, such as sodium-, potassium-hydroxide, and sodium-, potassium-silicate, which poses serious hazards to man and environment. This paper addresses the ways of discarding the involvement of the aforementioned alkaline solutions in soft soil stabilization by investigating the potential of a coupled electro kinetic alkaline activation technique for soft soil strengthening, through which the provision of alkaline pH is governed by electro kinetic potential. Uncertainties in regard to the dissolution of aluminosilicate as well as the dominance of acidic front are challenges that need to be overcome. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'In Malaysia, although there are several researches on engineering properties of residual soils, however study on the hydraulic conductivity properties of metasedimentary residual soils is still lacking. Construction of containment walls like slurry wall techniques can be achieved with hydraulic conductivity of approximately 5 x 10-7cm/sec. The objectives of the study were to determine the physical properties of metasedimentary residual soils and to determine the influence of 1%, 3%, 5% and 10% of cement on hydraulic conductivity parameters. The coefficient of hydraulic conductivity of the soil naturally and soil-cement mixtures were determined by using the falling head test. According to the test, the hydraulic conductivity of the original soil was 4.16 x 10-8 m/s. The value decreases to 3.89 x 10-8 m/s, 2.78 x 10-8 m/s then 6.83 x 10-9 m/s with the addition of 1%, 3% and 5% of cement additives, respectively. During the hydration process, cement hydrates is formed followed by the increase in pH value and Ca(OH)2 which will alter the modification of pores size and distribution. When the quantity of cement increases, the pores size decrease. But, the addition of 10% cement gives an increased hydraulic conductivity value to 2.78 x 10-8 m/s. With 10%, the pore size increase might due to flocculation and agglomeration reaction. The generated hydraulic conductivity values will indirectly become a guide in the preliminary soil cement stabilization to modify the properties of the soil to become more like the properties of a soft rock.1.

Recognizing the importance of water quality, new alternatives for drinking water such as mineral water processing from reverse osmosis (RO) machine become more popular. Hence, the demand for mineral water, natural spring water or water from the hills or mountains rose lately. More consumers believed the quality of these spring water better than other source of drinking water. However, the quality of all the drinking water sources is to meet the required quality standard. Therefore, this paper aims to measure the quality of the waters from hills, from RO machine and the water supply in Ulu Yam, Selangor Batang Kali, Malaysia. The water quality was determined based on following parameters: ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3), iron (Fe), turbidity (NTU) and pH. The results show that the water from hills has better quality compared to water supply and water from RO machine. The value of NH3 ranged from 0.03 mg/L- 0.67 mg/L Fe was from 0.03mg/L - 0.12 mg/L, turbidity at 0.42 NTU - 0.88 NTU and pH is at 6.60 - 0.71.

The model was well calibrated and verified by the measured data undertaken during dry season. The maximum salt intrusion length to the threshold of salinity density is 1.00 ppt on the existing condition was predicted at 9.97 km from the river mouth. Moreover, with the magnitude of 100.00 m3s-1 and 30.00 m3s-1 freshwater discharges at the upstream boundary (Kpg Tanggol), it was predicted the maximum salt intrusion length was 11.84 km and 21.41 km, respectively, from the river mouth. Therefore, it was determined the minimum freshwater discharge of approximately 100.00 m3s-1 is required at the Kpg Tanggol river gauging station, in order to maintain the acceptable salinity levels at the Pulau Musang freshwater pump house. However, the actual water discharge at the Kpg Tanggol boundary station should be higher, since the minimum discharge does not take into consideration the amount of water extraction by the Pulau Musang and SATU pump stations.

Peat soils are the results from the decomposition of organic matter and the type of peat can be classified based on the fibrous material in the soil. In the engineering field, peat soil was mostly known as soils that has a serious settlement with high compressibility index. From the previous research, fibers in the soil were influenced in compressibility in terms of size, shape, fibric, soil arrangement and etc. Hence, this study attempts the determination of fibers effects on the compressibility of peat using a 1-D oedometer consolidation test. The reconstituted peat samples of different particle sizes were used to determine the consolidation parameters and the results obtained from reconstituted samples were also compared with the undisturbed sample. 1-D oedometer consolidation tests were performed on the samples by using the load increment method. The results shows, the higher particle size (R3.35), give higher moisture content (w = 401.20%) and higher initial void ratio (eo = 5.74). In settlement prediction, the higher the fiber content will results the higher the compression index, therefore, it will cause high of settlement. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'A study of water quality and heavy metal content in Sembrong Dam water was conducted from April - August 2015.

Sembrong Dam is a major water source for some 120,000 people in the districts of Kluang and parts of Batu Pahat. The quality of water in Sembrong should be well-monitored in ensuring the continuous distribution of clean and safe water supply to peoples. Based on the news reported by The Star news dated on 11 May 2015, the water bodies in Sembrong Dam are polluted by the algae blooms which has started to cause problems in treating water phase by clogging up the filters and causing the production to be reduced and finally resulting in frequent water disruptions to residents. Therefore, there is a need to study the water quality of the dam water prior to further water treatment. One of important characterizations is by measuring chlorophyll-a and the isolation of the dominant microalgae species in the water body in which they are able to indicate the level of water pollution. This paper presents the determination of chlorophyll-a and the isolation of microalgae strains collected from Sembrong Dam. Chlorophyll-a is a photosynthetic pigment present in all species of phytoplankton, including algae and in some photosynthetic bacteria, known as cyanobacteria. The method used in measuring the chlorophyll-a is based on the standard method of IS0 10 260. The average chlorophyll-a concentration measured at Sembrong Dam is 175.9 μg L-1 and it is responsible for the appearance of green color in the sample and it is categorized into hypereutrophic state which is highly polluted. The technique used for isolation of microalgae strains is traditional method which is by spreading the sample on agar. The pure isolate indicated that the genus Botryococcus is the dominant algae species which is characterized morphologically. Both chlorophyll-a and microalgae isolation are good biological indicator that indicate the pollution of Sembrong Dam. The pure culture is very important that it can be used for further studies with series of different tests to understand its properties and character for sustainability approach towards environmentally friendly as well as for microalgae removal formula. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Air quality in the residential areas adjacent to the industrial regions is of great concern due to the association with human health risks.

The riverbed erosional and depositional process in the Chini River is a sluggish process since the lake reduces the flow velocity and causes the deposited particles into the silt and clay soil at the bed of the lake. Besides, the bed layer of the lake comprised of cohesive silt and clayey composition that tend to attach the larger grain size of sediment. The present study estimated the total sediment accumulated along the Chini River is 1.72 ton. The HEC-RAS was employed in the simulations and in general the model performed well, once all parameters were set within their effective ranges. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'This study focused on the evaluation of electrical resistivity method (ERM) for buried object detection and its relationship due to the different stiffness of material. In the past, the conventional method to detect the buried structure was face some limitation due to the time and cost. For example, previous approach related to the trial and error excavation has always expose to some risky outcome due to the uncertainties of the buried object location. Hence, this study introduced an alternative technique with particular reference to resistivity method to detect and evaluate the buried object with different strength of stiffness. The experiment was performed based on field miniature model (small scale study) using soil trial embankment made by lateritic soil and various concrete cube strengths (grade 20, 25 and 30) representing buried object with different conditions. 2D electrical resistivity test (electrical resistivity imaging) was perform using ABEM Terrameter SAS4000 during the data acquisition while the raw data was process using RES2DINV software. It was found that the electrical resistivity method was able to detect the buried concrete structures targeted based on the contrast of the electrical resistivity image produced. Moreover, three different strength of concrete cube were able to be differentiated based on the electrical resistivity values (ERV) obtained. This study found that the ERV of concrete cube for grade 20, 25 and 30 were 170 Ωm, 227 Ωm and 503 Ωm, respectively. Hence, this study shows that the ERV has a strong relationship with different stiffness of material thus applicable to be a useful alternative tool in underground structure detection. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"The aim of the research is to investigate the strength development of stabilised local Serian soil with RBI Grade 81 a chemical additive to enhance soil properties in term of strength. Serian is a town which is located about 60 km from Kuching city where the soil was chosen to be treated in this study. The soil sample was mixed with 2%, 6% and 8% of RBI Grade 81 by weight of dry soil and added with water at optimum water content (OWC) to replicate field site conditions. The modified samples were cured in ambient air for 7, 14, and 28 days.

Temporal trends in the inter-arrival times of occurrence of drought events were examined for 21 selected stations across Victoria, Australia. In the present study, the Standardize Precipitation Index (SPI) was applied for 12-month time scale to identify drought. A drought event here is defined as a period in which the SPI is continuously negative and reaching a value of -1.0 or less. Often, nonparametric tests are commonly used to test for trends including in discrete events. However, discrete events are not constant because of the presence of zero values or non-normality of data. The methodology applies to long-term records of event counts and is based on the stochastic concepts of Poisson process and standard linear regression. Overall, of the 21 stations, 15 showed statistically significant increasing frequency indicates those events are becoming more frequent. Only one station gave insignificant result. The remaining 5 stations showed the time between events was significantly increasing designates droughts are becoming less frequent. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Floods that struck Johor state in 2006 and 2007 and the East Coastal in 2014 have triggered a greatly impact to the flood management here in Malaysia.

The main objective of the research is to investigate the physics of scour below skewed pipeline in river crossing as well as the time variations of the scour development. In this study, the experiments were conducted for four different angles of pipe (30°, 45°, 60° and 90°) across a channel and placed on the sediment bed with e/D = 0. The scour development for flow shallowness y/D = 3 and y/D = 4, initiated at downstream side of the pipe, where the bed sediment appeared to be ejected from the bed due to the piping effect process. At the initial stage, the scour process for 150mm flow depth enlarged rapidly. Whilst, the scour process for 200 mm flow depth slowly developed and after certain time, the sediment bed scoured rapidly. The scour depth increased considerably at development stage and the suspended load near the bed especially below the pipe decreased significantly compared to the initial stage. The rate of sediment eroded from the sediment bed decreased at the stabilization phase. The equilibrium phase of the scour depth considered achieved as the dimensions of the scour hole do not change significantly. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Construction on soft ground area is a great challenge in the field of geotechnical engineering.

Clay was known as a soil with complex natural formations and very difficult to obtain undisturbed samples at the site. The aim of this paper was to determine the unconfined shear strength of remoulded clay on different methods in moulding samples which were proctor compaction, hand operated soil compacter and miniature mould methods. All the samples were remoulded with the same optimum moisture content (OMC) and density that were 18% and 1880 kg/m3 respectively. The unconfined shear strength results of remoulding clay soils for proctor compaction method was 289.56kPa with the strain 4.8%, hand operated method was 261.66kPa with the strain 4.4% and miniature mould method was 247.52kPa with the strain 3.9%. Based on the proctor compaction method, the reduction percentage of unconfined shear strength of remoulded clay soil of hand operated method was 9.66%, and for miniature mould method was 14.52%. Thus, because there was no significant difference of reduction percentage of unconfined shear strength between three different methods, so it can be concluded that remoulding clay by hand operated method and miniature mould method were accepted and suggested to perform remoulding clay samples by other future researcher. However for comparison, the hand operated method was more suitable to form remoulded clay sample in term of easiness, saving time and less energy for unconfined shear strength determination purposes. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'In over many years, considerable research has been carried out on organic soils which consists of various components of organic matter but the effect of particular organic matter is less reported.

It could helps to store treated rainwater for more beneficial use and also for flood mitigation. Sustainable approach for flooding problem reduction in urban areas is by slowing down the rate of surface runoff flows at source by providing more storage area/tank. In order to understand the performance of a rainwater harvesting system (RWH), a preliminary monitoring on a 'do it yourself' (DIY) RWH model with additional first -flush strategy for water quality treatment was done. The main concept behind first flush diversion is to prevent initial polluted rainwater from entering the storage tank. Based on seven rainfall events observed in Parit Raja, both quality and quantity of the rainfalls were analysed. For rainwater quality, the samples from first flush diverter and storage tank were taken to understand their performance based on pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity, total dissolved solid (TDS), total suspended solid (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) parameters. While for rainwater quantity, hydrograph analysis were done based on the performance of total rainfall and runoff, peak flow of rainfall and runoff and delayed time parameters. Based on Interim National Water Quality Standard (INWQS) and National Drinking Water Quality Standard (NDWQS), first flush diverter apparently helps on water quality improvement in storage tanks when pH, DO, TDS, TSS and turbidity were classified as Class I (INWQS) and is allowable for drinking but BOD and COD parameters were classified as Class III (INWQS). Hence, it has potential to be used as potable usage but will need extensive treatment to reduce its poor microbial quality. Based on the maximum observed rainfall event which had total volume of 3195.5 liter, had peakflow reduction from 0.00071 m3/s to 0.00034 m3/s and delayed runoff between 5 and 10 minutes after rainfall started. It concludes that the performance of water retention could be due to total rainfall and the tank capacity. Therefore, RWH has a potential to be used as potable use and at the same time it also has a potential to reduce local urban flooding. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'Solid waste management is recognised as one of the most challenging issues confronted by both the developed and developing countries.

This pH value is not suitable for the growth of any plants especially for the soil stabilization purposes. Gradation weathering within the range of 4 to 6 indicates an incomplete/partial weathering process. The soil grade in this range is known as a black shale mudstone. Beside, this also influences to a factor of the high surface water runoff at this particular soil species. As the acidic pH become a major problem for soil fertilizing hence an appropriate technique was implemented known as using 'Electrokinetic Remediation', EKR. This technique has a great potential in changing the soil pH value from acidic to less acidic and also kept maintain the pH at the saturated rate of electrochemical process. This research study presents the monitoring data of pH value due to the effect of various electrolyte consist of 0.5M of MgSO4, KH2PO4, and Na(NO3). Here, the distilled water (DW) was used as reference solution. The electric field was provided by dipping two pieces of identical rectangular aluminum foil as anode and cathode. The EKR was conducted under a constant voltage gradient of 50 V/m across the sample bulk at 0.14 m length measured between both electrodes. The data collection was conducted during the total period of 7 days surveillance. The variation of pH values at the remediation area between anode and cathode for various type of electrolyte indicates that there are a significant saturated value as it reaches 7 days of treatment. During the analysis, it is found that the highest pH value at the remediation area after 7 days treatment using Na(NO3), KH2PO4 and MgSO4 was 3.93, 3.33 and 3.39 respectively. Hence from the last stage of pH value observation, it can be conclude that the best electrolyte for barren soil treatment is Na(NO3) whereby it contribute to highest pH value and turn the soil to be less acidic. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'This research demonstrated the use of Remote Sensing technique and GIS to determine the suitability of an evacuation center.

The thermal characteristics of the coals were investigated prior to direct liquefaction in order to determine the liquefaction performance, i.e. coal conversion and oil yield. The differential weight loss (DTG) results for both coals showed that there are three main stages evolved which consists of moisture, volatile matter and heavier hydrocarbons that correspond to temperature range of 150, 200-500 and 550-800°C, respectively. Apparently, the DTG curves of BA coal reveals a similar pattern of thermal evolution profile in comparison to that of the MB coal. However, the calculated mean reactivity of BA coal is higher than that of MB, which implied that BA would probably enhance coal conversion and oil yield in comparison to MB coal. Interestingly, results showed that under the same liquefaction conditions (i.e. at 4MPa pressure and 420°C), conversion and oil yield of both coals were well correlated with their reactivity and petrofactor value obtained. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Geological formation is a one of information need to know during site reconnaissance. Conventional method like borehole has been known is very accurate to identify the formation of geology of a site. However, the problem of this technique is very expensive and not economical for large area. In the last decade, microtremor measurement has been introduced as an alternative technique and widely used in the geological formation study. Therefore, the aim in this study is to determine the geological formation underneath of surface in Batu Pahat district using microtremor measurement. There are two parameters have been carried out from microtremor measurement in term of natural frequency and HVSR curves images. Microtremor measurements are done conducted at 15 sites surrounding of Batu Pahat. Horizontal to vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) method was used for analyzing microtermor measurement data, to determine the natural frequency and also HVSR curves image. In this study, values of natural frequencies are used to classify the soil types with range in the between 0.93 to 5.35 Hz, meanwhile the pattern of HVSR curve images has been shown exists a few groups of soil types surrounding Batu Pahat district. Hence, microtremor measurement indirectly can be used as a one technique to add value in the site reconnaissance in the future. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Soil losses from hill slopes in oil palm plantation in Sedenak Estate, Johor were measured using runoff plot and rainfall simulator. The plot was designed to be removable but the size was fixed at 8 x 3.75m. Four types of surface covers were investigated for the plots, i.e. half bare soil and half grass cover (HGC), half bare soil and half dry frond (HDF), fully grass cover (FG), and fully bare soil (BS). The influence of initial soil moisture, saturated hydraulics conductivity, Ks, bulk density and slope on rates of soil loss were also evaluated. The rainfall simulator produced rainfall intensities between 90 and 160 mm/hr with durations from 45 to 60 min per run. BS plot exhibited the highest Ks value among all plots but the percentage of initial soil moisture on this surface was low. BS plot recorded the highest runoff coefficient (C) and soil loss values of 73.6 ± 4 percent and 5.26 ± 3.2 t/ha respectively, while the lowest was from plot FG with 41.7 ± 5.7 percent and soil loss of 2.85 ± 2.1 t/ha. Meanwhile, the results suggested that the ground cover had the ability to reduce soil loss by 67% and 17%, respectively for plots BS-HGC and BS-HDF. Overall, soil erosion control such as surface is effective measures in reducing level of runoff and soil erosion. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Weathering process of granitic material results in the formation of relict joint in lateritic layer of the weathering profile. The number and arrangements of the relict joints affects the permeability of the residual soil which invariably affects water flow and suction distribution in the residual soil. Although the permeability of residual soil without a relict joint can be determined using standard permeability test, it is difficult to be measured when a relict joint is incorporated due to limitation of size and area of the standard equipment. Hence, modified permeability test equipment is introduced in this study. Two arrangement of the relict joint in the equipment were considered. In the first arrangement one relict joint with various spacing were tested while the orientation and spacing of the relict joint were tested using two relict joints in the second arrangement. The results obtained shows that the permeability of the residual soil due to one and two relict joint varies by two orders of magnitude. Therefore, the number and spacing of relict joints modified the permeability of residual soil. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Observations made of two common failures of structures founded on peat/organic soil in Johor, Malaysia is presented. Critical evaluation of current lightweight fill technology to mitigate such settlement is also discussed. Lightweight technology, such as Expanded Polystyrene (EPS), has been used in construction on soft yielding ground for decades. Regrettably, some published information of EPS failures to perform on construction sites are also cited in this paper.

The reported results showed that the structural behaviour of the reinforced geopolymer concrete members is similar to the known behaviour of the ordinary reinforced concrete members. In addition, the currently available standards have been conservatively used for analysis and designing of reinforced geopolymer concrete structures.

Conventional glass reinforced epoxy pipes has its own disadvantages such as high corrosion resistance at acidic environment and low strength which can be replaced by the composite pipes. Geopolymer is a type of amorphous alumino-silicate and can be synthesized by geopolymerization process. A series of glass reinforced epoxy pipe and glass reinforced epoxy pipe filled with 10 - 40 weight percentage geopolymer filler which is fly ash with 4 Molarity were prepared.

SEM analyses confirmed that the MCl2 (where M = Cu2+ or Ni2+) induced porous structures with pore sizes ranging from 0.3 - 2.0 μm. The average pore size increased with the increasing MCl2 content. There existed weak physical interactions between the PHB chains and MCl2 as revealed by FTIR and NMR spectroscopies. The residue of MCl2 in the porous PHB film does not exert significant influence on the thermal stability of PHB.

The purpose of this research is to study the correlation between kaolin: liquid ratio with the performance of kaolin geopolymer. Kaolin, a prominent raw geopolymer material was used to prepare enhanced geopolymer paste by mixing with alkaline activator solution. Interrelationship of kaolin to alkaline liquid ratio with hardness and flexural strength was the focus of this work. Therefore kaolin geopolymer paste with varying solid to liquid ratio ranging from 0.7 to 1.1 was prepared. Geopolymer paste was coated on low grade wood substrate prior to Vickers hardness and flexural strength.

Concerning with the toxicity of lead in Sn-37Pb solder alloy, developing lead free solder alloy with low melting temperature is one of the most important issues in electronic industry. Previously, researchers found out that the most promising candidate of lead free solder alloy is Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu (SAC). However, the melting temperature of this solder alloy is 217°C, 34°C higher than Sn-37Pb. This can lead to high energy consumption in electronic industry.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) testing shows that this solder alloy gave low melting temperature as low as 141.31°C. The addition of Ga in In-Zn solder alloy lowered the melting temperature compared to SAC and Sn-37Pb. From coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) analysis, the In-Zn-Ga solder alloy gives good expansion properties and able to avoid the mismatch between the solder and copper substrates.

However, cement production releases high amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere that leads to increasing the global warming. Thus, an alternative, environmental friendly construction material such as geopolymer concrete has been developed.

This platform was designed with three hulls that were placed in triangle position. The hulls designed were in the form of rudders-shape and were vertically placed as a slender body shape using NACA 64-0012 profile. This provides the USV with low-drag characteristic. The application of stability and resistance theories investigated the effect of the configuration position of the three hulls for this platform.

Besides, coal ash produced from coal combustion contains heavy metals within their compositions. These metals are toxic to the environment as well as to human health. Fortunately, treatment methods are available for these ashes, and the use of fly ash and bottom ash in the concrete mix is one of the few. Therefore, an experimental program was carried out to study the properties and determine the leachability of selfcompacting concrete incorporated with fly ash and bottom ash. For experimental study, self-compacting concrete was produced with fly ash as a replacement for Ordinary Portland Cement and bottom ash as a replacement for sand with the ratios of 10%, 20%, and 30% respectively. The fresh properties tests conducted were slump flow, t500, sieve segregation and J-ring. Meanwhile for the hardened properties, density, compressive strength and water absorption test were performed. The samples were then crushed to be extracted using Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure and heavy metals content within the samples were identified accordingly using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. The results demonstrated that both fresh and hardened properties were qualified to categorize as self-compacting concrete. Improvements in compressive strength were observed, and densities for all the samples were identified as a normal weight concrete with ranges between 2000 kg/m3 to 2600 kg/m3. Other than that, it was found that incorporation up to 30% of the ashes was safe as the leached heavy metals concentration did not exceed the regulatory levels, except for arsenic.

Modelling the structure of the geopolymerization products is essential for controlling the product properties. The currently available models have shown some limitations in determining the rate of geopolymerization and setting time of the gel. There is a need for deeper knowledge regarding the physicochemical analysis of geopolymer binders. Most of the available models have used pure material like metakaolin however, the less pure materials are expected to have different mechanisms. The FTIR and MAS-NMR analysis are considered as effective tools in providing information on the molecular deviations during geopolymerization.

The commonly practised organic solvent oil extraction technique could be replaced with a modified microwave extraction. Jatropha seeds (Jatropha curcas) were used to extract bio-oil. Clean samples were heated in an oven at 110 ° C for 24 hours to remove moisture content and ground to obtain particle size smaller than 500μm. Extraction was carried out at different extraction times 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 60 min and 120 min to determine oil yield. The biooil yield obtained from microwave assisted extraction system at 90 minutes was 36% while that from soxhlet extraction for 6 hours was 42%. Bio-oil extracted using the microwave assisted extraction (MAE) system could enhance yield of bio-oil compared to soxhlet extraction. The MAE extraction system is rapid using only water as solvent which is a nonhazardous, environment-friendly technique compared to soxhlet extraction (SE) method using hexane as solvent. Thus, this is a green technique of bio-oil extraction using only water as extractant. Bio-oil extraction from the pyrolysis of empty fruit bunch (EFB), a biomass waste from oil palm crop, was enhanced using a biocatalyst derived from seashell waste. Oil yield for non-catalytic extraction was 43.8% while addition of seashell based biocatalyst was 44.6%. Oil yield for non-catalytic extraction was 43.8% while with addition of seashell-based biocatalyst was 44.6%. The pH of bio-oil increased from 3.5 to 4.3. The viscosity of bio-oil obtained by catalytic means increased from 20.5 to 37.8 cP. A rapid and environment friendly extraction technique is preferable to enhance bio-oil yield.

In global market, use of Facebook platform indicated that food services/restaurant of food industry is ranked number 11 with 18.8% users' response rate within the platform. This development calls for e-marketers in Malaysia to use Facebook as their viral advertising channel. Attitudinal factors affecting the viral advertising pass-on behaviour (VAPB) especially among members of social media is of interest to many researchers. The typical attitudinal factors used were attitude toward social media (ATSM), attitude toward advertising in social media (AASM) and attitude toward advertising in general (AAIG). Attitude toward advertised brand (ATAB) is important in fast food industry because users of social media tend to share their experience about tastes and features of the food. However, ATAB is less emphasized in the conceptual model between attitudinal factors and VAPB. These four factors of consumer attitude served as independent variables in the conceptual model of this study and their effect on viral advertising pass-on behaviour among members of Domino's Pizza Malaysia Facebook page was examined. Online survey using a set of questionnaire which was sent to the members of this group via private message was employed. A total of 254 sets of usable questionnaires were collected from the respondents. All the attitudinal factors, except for AASM, were found to have positive and significant effect on VAPB. AAIG exerted the strongest effect on VAPB. Therefore, e-marketers should emphasize on developing a favourable attitude toward advertising in general among members of a social media to get them involve in viral advertising.

However, in aggressive environment, Inconel 625 will suffer corrosion attack like other metals. This research compared the corrosion performance of Inconel 625 when exposed to higher sulphate content compared to real seawater. The results reveal that Inconel 625 is excellent in resist the corrosion attack in seawater. However, at increasing temperature, the corrosion resistance of this metal decrease. The performance is same in seawater with high sulphate content at increasing temperature. It can be concluded that sulphate promote perforation on Inconel 625 and become aggressive agents that accelerate the corrosion attack. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Currently, carbon nanotube (CNT) is attracting much interest as fibrous materials for reinforcing aluminum matrix composites due to unique properties, such as high strength, elastic modulus, flexibility and high aspect ratios. However, the quality of the dispersion is the major concerning factor which determines the homogeneity of the enhanced mechanical and tribological properties of the composite. This work study and characterized carbon nanotube dispersion in ballmilled CNT-aluminum mixed powders with four different formulations such as 1, 1.5, 2 and 2.5 wt% CNT under high energy planetary ball milling operations. The ball milling was performed for two hours at constant milling speed of 250 rpm under controlled atmosphere. The characterization is performed using FESEM and EDX analyzer for mapping, elemental and line analysis. The experimental results showed homogeneous dispersion of CNTs in aluminum matrix. The composite mixture showed similar pattern from mapping, elemental and line analysis. Identification of only two peaks proved that controlled atmosphere during milling prevented the formation of inter metallic compounds such as aluminum carbide in the composite mixture.

Keropok is made from fish, squid or shrimp mixed with starch or sago flour and eggs. In Malaysia, keropok industry is widely operated at the coastal areas where the fish/seafood supply can be easily accessed. Keropok need to be dried before the packaging process. At the moment, conventional method was used where the keropok is arranged under the sunlight on a board called pemidai. The method is considered less hygienic since it exposed to the dirt and dust and less practical especially during the raining season. This research is focusing on a new automation technique to solve the problems. Rotary drum with internal holder was developed as the drying machine. Keropok keping (types of keropok) was selected to be experimented using the machine with three different rotating speeds. Preliminary experiment result shows that the broken rate of the keropok keping was around 27% of the total weight. The development of new automation system is hoped to improve the small medium enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'This paper discusses the design of dynamic curvature steering control for autonomous vehicle.

The aim of this paper is to investigate such pressure gradient in laboratory scale. For this purpose polishing tests were performed on ceramic tiles according to the industrial practices using a custom-made CNC tribometer. Gradual wear on both abrasives and machined surface of the floor tile were measured. The experimental results suggested that the pressure gradient tends to cause an inclination of the abraded surfaces, which becomes stable after a given polishing period. In addition to the wear depth of the machined surface, the highest value of gloss and finest surface finish were observed at the lowest point of the worn out surface of the ceramic floor tile corresponding to the point of highest pressure and lowest scratching speed. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'High speed milling is one of the recent technologies used to produce mould inserts due to the need for high surface finish.

Wear of the nozzle becomes a major problem since it may affect the water jet machining performance. Design, materials, and life of the nozzle give significance effect to the nozzle wear. There are various parameters that may influence the wear rate of the nozzle such as nozzle length, nozzle inlet angle, nozzle diameter, orifice diameter, abrasive flow rate and water pressure. The wear rate of the nozzle can be minimized by controlling these parameters. The mechanism of wear in the nozzle is similar to other traditional machining processes which uses a cutting tool. The high pressure of the water and hard abrasive particles may Erode the nozzle wall. A new nozzle using a tungsten carbide-based material has been developed to reduce the wear rate and improve the nozzle life.

Such condition results in the formation of a spherical thermal gradient field (TGF) around each particle. Hence, the interstitials (low temperature) of such TGFs are the regions to reach the nucleation temperature first, owing to low energy barrier than the liquid-particle interface (higher temperature). Analytics also indicate that the nucleation rate is higher at the TGF interstitials, than at the liquid-particle interface. Such TGF network results in simultaneous nucleation throughout the system, resulting in grain refinement. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Resistance spot welding of dissimilar thickness of AA5052 aluminum alloy was performed in order to investigate the effect of metal thickness on the weldment strength. Resistance spot welding was done using a spot welder machine available in Coraza Systems Sdn Bhd using a hemispherical of chromium copper electrode tip with radius of 6.00 mm under 14 kA of current and 0.02 bar of pressure for all thickness combinations. Lap joint configuration was produced between 2.0 mm thick sheet and 1.2 - 3.2 mm thick sheet, respectively. Microstructure of joint showed asymmetrical nugget shape that was larger on the thicker side indicating larger molten metal volume. Joint 2.0 mm x 3.2 mm sheets has the lowest hardness in both transverse direction and through thickness direction because less heat left in the weld nugget. The microstructure shows that this joint has coarse grains of HAZ. As thickness of sheet metal increased, the failure load of the joints increased. However, there was no linear correlation established between joint strength and metal thickness due to different shape of fusion zone in dissimilar thickness sheet metal. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The fatigue crack propagation behaviour of a cast hybrid metal matrix composite (MMC) was investigated and compared with the crack propagation behaviour of MMC with Al2O3 and Al alloy in this article. Three dimensional (3D) surface analysis is carried out to analyze the crack propagation mechanism. All three materials clearly show near threshold and stable crack growth regions, but the rapid crack growth region is not clearly understood. The crack propagation resistance is found higher in hybrid MMC than that of MMC with Al2O3 whisker and the Al alloy in the low ΔK region. The crack propagation in the hybrid MMC in the near-threshold region is directed by the debonding of reinforcement-matrix followed by void nucleation in the Al alloy matrix. Besides, the crack propagation in the stable- or midcrack-growth region is controlled by the debonding of particle-matrix and whisker-matrix interface caused by the cycle-by-cycle crack growth along the interface. The transgranular fracture of the reinforcement and void formation are also observed. Due to presence of large volume of inclusions and the microstructural inhomogeneity, the area of striation formation is reduced in the hybrid MMC, caused the unstable fracture. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The implementation of underground watering system is basically to supply crops with enough quantities of water.

The appropriate substrate properties are necessary especially to avoid detachment during machining and to minimize deformation and warping of the machined thin workpiece. Thus, the investigations of the influence of substrate properties on micro-cutting thin workpiece are essentially to be conducted. The finite element study of orthogonal micro-cutting of thin Al6061-T6 is presented here. The simulations were conducted to study the residual stress profile across the thickness of the machined thin workpiece at various workpiece thicknesses and various substrate (adhesive) elastic properties. Simulations results show that as the machined workpiece become thinner, the stress is more significant not only on the machined surface but also it can reach the bottom of the workpiece. The stiffer substrate produces less variation of the stress across the workpiece thickness while more compliant substrate produces broader stress variation as the workpiece become thinner. The results show the significant effect of the workpiece thickness and the substrate properties on the stress profiles in the micro-cutting of thin workpiece. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'This paper presents a preliminary study on the prominent barriers to lean manufacturing implementation in Malaysian Food and Beverages Industry.

The obtained results show that density and hardness of the composites are greatly influenced by volume fraction of silicon carbide particulates. Results also show that density, hardness and microstructure of Al-SiC composites are significantly influenced depending on the compaction load. The increase in the volume fraction of SiC enhances the density and hardness of the Al/SiC composites. For 15 ton compaction load, the composites show increased density and hardness as well as improved microstructure than the composites prepared under 10 ton compaction load.

Randomly-shaped silica (SiO2) particles of various sizes (300-355μm, 355-500μm, and 500- 600μm) were selected as the erosive element. Impingement angles between 15-90°, impingement velocities between 30-50 m/sec, and stand-off distances of 15-25 mm at ambient temperature were selected. During experiment, the maximum erosion of the tested composite occurred at 60° impingement angle, indicating a semi-ductile nature of the test material. Erosion increased with impact velocity and decreased with stand-off distance. In a dimensional analysis, erosion efficiency (η) and the relationship between friction and erosion were established. Test results were evaluated using Taguchi's concept to minimize the observations needed, and ANOVA was used to identify interactions between tested parameters and to identify the most significant parameters. The S/N ratio indicates that there is only percentage of deviation between the predicted and experimental results.

A specific class of MMCs which has gained a lot of attention due to its potential is aluminium metal matrix composites (Al-MMCs). Product performance investigation of Al- MMCs is presented in this article, where an Al-MMCs brake disc is analyzed using finite element analysis. The objective is to identify the potentiality of replacing the conventional iron brake disc with Al-MMCs brake disc. The simulation results suggested that the MMCs brake disc provided better thermal and mechanical performance as compared to the conventional cast iron brake disc. Although, the Al-MMCs brake disc dissipated higher maximum temperature compared to cast iron brake disc's maximum temperature. The Al-MMCs brake disc showed a well distributed temperature than the cast iron brake disc. The high temperature developed at the ring of the disc and heat was dissipated in circumferential direction. Moreover, better thermal dissipation and conduction at brake disc rotor surface played a major influence on the stress. As a comparison, the maximum stress and strain of Al-MMCs brake disc was lower than that induced on the cast iron brake disc. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'During the process of Gas Metal Arc (GMAW) welding, the weld joints mechanical properties are influenced by the welding parameters such as welding current and arc voltage.

Fifteen healthy adolescents participated in this study and they were divided into five age groups (13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 years). Subjects were performed dynamic contraction during lifting a standard weight (3-kg dumbbell) and EMG signals were recorded from their Biceps Brachii (BB) muscle. Two common EMG analysis techniques namely root mean square (RMS) and mean absolute values (MAV) were used to find the differences. The statistical analysis was included: linear regression to examine the relationships between EMG amplitude and age, repeated measures ANOVA to assess differences among the variables, and finally Coefficient of Variation (CoV) for signal steadiness among the groups of subjects during contraction. The result from RMS and MAV analysis shows that the 17-years age groups exhibited higher activity (0.28 and 0.19 mV respectively) compare to other groups (13-Years: 0.26 and 0.17 mV, 14-years: 0.25 and 0.23 mV, 15-Years: 0.23 and 0.16 mV, 16-years: 0.23 and 0.16 mV respectively). Also, this study shows modest correlation between age and signal activities among all age group's muscle. The experiential results can play a pivotal role for developing EMG prosthetic hand controller, neuromuscular system, EMG based rehabilitation aid and movement biomechanics, which may help to separate age groups among the adolescents. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'Photovoltaic (PV) module consists of numbers of photovoltaic cells that are connected in series and parallel used to generate electricity from solar energy.

The efficiency of these can be low due to the formation of oxide layer which passivate the anodes. Currently, to improve its efficiency, there are efforts using a new technique called surface modifications. The objective of this research is to study corrosion mechanism of aluminium sacrificial anode which has been processed by cold work. The cold works are applied by reducing the thickness of aluminium sacrificial anodes at 20% and 40% of thickness reduction. The cathodic protection experiments were performed by immersion of aluminium connected to carbon steel cylinder in 3% NaCl solutions. Visual inspections using SEM had been conducted during the experiments and corrosion rate data were taken in every week for 8 weeks of immersion time.

Generally, the deposition method of a titanium dioxide coating is carried out by an organic system binder but the powerful photocatalytic reaction will degrades the binder. Therefore, thermal spray is considered to be the alternative method but this method will induce crystallization transformation of titanium dioxide from anatase phase with high photocatalytic activity to rutile phase with low photocatalyst which caused by high heat input. Since our microwave plasma spraying device is operable at low power comparing with conventional high power plasma spray, the reduce effect of the heat input onto the particles at the time of spraying can be achieved and coating deposition with high rate of anatase phase is expected.

This paper therefore seeks to present a conceptual model for evaluation of LPD performances by identifying and analysing the core existing LPD enabler (Chief Engineer, Cross-functional teams, Set-based engineering, Poka-yoke (mistakeproofing), Knowledge-based environment, Value-focused planning and development, Top management support, Technology, Supplier integration, Workforce commitment and Continuous improvement culture) for assessing the LPD performance. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'In reliability theory, the most important problem is to determine the reliability of a complex system from the reliability of its components. The weakness of most reliability theories is that the systems are described and explained as simply functioning or failed. In many real situations, the failures may be from many causes depending upon the age and the environment of the system and its components. Another problem in reliability theory is one of estimating the parameters of the assumed failure models. The estimation may be based on data collected over censored or uncensored life tests. In many reliability problems, the failure data are simply quantitatively inadequate, especially in engineering design and maintenance system. The Bayesian analyses are more beneficial than the classical one in such cases. The Bayesian estimation analyses allow us to combine past knowledge or experience in the form of an apriori distribution with life test data to make inferences of the parameter of interest. In this paper, we have investigated the application of the Bayesian estimation analyses to competing risk systems. The cases are limited to the models with independent causes of failure by using the Weibull distribution as our model. A simulation is conducted for this distribution with the objectives of verifying the models and the estimators and investigating the performance of the estimators for varying sample size. The simulation data are analyzed by using Bayesian and the maximum likelihood analyses. The simulation results show that the change of the true of parameter relatively to another will change the value of standard deviation in an opposite direction. For a perfect information on the prior distribution, the estimation methods of the Bayesian analyses are better than those of the maximum likelihood. The sensitivity analyses show some amount of sensitivity over the shifts of the prior locations. They also show the robustness of the Bayesian analysis within the range between the true value and the maximum likelihood estimated value lines. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'In this paper our effort is to introduce the basic notions that constitute a competing risks models in reliability analysis using Bayesian analysis approach with Gamma distribution as our model and presenting their analytic methods. The Gamma distribution is widely used in reliability analysis and it is known as an natural extension of the exponential distribution. The cases are limited to the models with independent causes of failure, only the scale parameter is a random variable, and uniform prior distribution is used in our analysis. This model describes the likelihood function and follows with the description of the posterior function and the estimations of the point, interval, hazard function, and reliability. The net probability of failure if only one specific risk is present, crude probability of failure due to a specific risk in the presence of other causes, and partial crude probabilities are also included. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Product development (PD) consists of several activities and one of early stage in PD is conceptual design stage which is the most crucial stage in developing a new product.

As a consequence, the solutions obtained from the traditional scheduling technique are ineffective wherever changes occur to the system. Therefore, this research intends to develop a decision support tool (DST) based on promising artificial intelligent that is able to accommodate the dynamics that regularly occur in job shop scheduling problem. The DST was designed through three phases, i.e. (i) the look-up table generation, (ii) inverse model development and (iii) integration of DST components. This paper reports the generation of look-up tables for various scenarios as a part in development of the DST. A discrete event simulation model was used to compare the performance among SPT, EDD, FCFS, S/OPN and Slack rules the best performances measures (mean flow time, mean tardiness and mean lateness) and the job order requirement (inter-arrival time, due dates tightness and setup time ratio) which were compiled into look-up tables.

Aluminium alloy as a matter of fact has a low melting point and high ductility that severely adhere to the cutting tool surface and cause deterioration of chip evacuation. This problem often resulting in tools breakage. In this paper, in order to impart functions of anti-adhesion, we propose a technique by controlling the grinding marks micro texture on the tool surface by using the blast polishing treatment without any coating technologies. The results show that the tool which underwent polishing treatment reduces the cutting force as well as the aluminium adherence during the initial cutting process, and become worst as the process cutting continues. These results indicate that grinding mark texture improves the anti-adhesion by reducing the contact area during cutting and provide storage for the lubricant. In addition, too much polishing on the tool surface may remove these textures and resultantly worsen the tool performance. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Friction properties of plastic materials are very important under dry sliding contact conditions for bearing applications. In the present research, friction properties of engineering plastics such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and nylon are investigated under dry sliding contact conditions. In the experiments, PTFE and nylon slide against different rough counterfaces such as mild steel and stainless steel 316 (SS 316). Frictional tests are carried out at low loads 5, 7.5 and 10 N, low sliding velocities 0.5, 0.75 and 1 m/s and relative humidity 70%. The obtained results reveal that friction coefficient of PTFE increases with the increase in normal loads and sliding velocities within the observed range. On the other hand, frictional values of nylon decrease with the increase in normal loads and sliding velocities. It is observed that in general, these polymers show higher frictional values when sliding against SS 316 rather than mild steel. During running-in process, friction coefficient of PTFE and nylon steadily increases with the increase in rubbing time and after certain duration of rubbing, it remains at steady level. At identical operating conditions, the frictional values are significantly different depending on normal load, sliding velocity and material pair. It is also observed that in general, the influence of normal load on the friction properties of PTFE and nylon is greater than that of sliding velocity. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'A case study was selected as a method to collect data in actual industry situation.

In this paper, a machine vision approach was employed to detect the tool fracture in commercial aluminium oxide ceramic cutting tool during turning of AISI 52100 hardened steel. The contour of the workpiece profile was captured with the aid of backlighting during turning using a high-resolution DSLR camera with a shutter speed of 1/4000 s. The surface profile of the workpiece was extracted to sub-pixel accuracy using the invariant moment method. The effect of fracture in ceramic cutting tools on the surface profile signature of the machined workpiece using autocorrelation was studied. Fracture in the aluminum oxide ceramic tool was found to cause the peaks of autocorrelation function of the workpiece profile to decrease rapidly as the lag distance increased. The envelope of the peaks of the autocorrelation function was observed to deviate significantly from one another at different workpiece angles when the tool has fractured due to the continuous fracture of ceramic cutting insert during machining. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'In the effort for manufacturing companies to meet up with the emerging consumer demands for mass customized products, many are turning to the application of lean in their product development process, and this is gradually moving from being a competitive advantage to a necessity.

The use of an indexer allows the workpiece to be rotated to various orientations which directly increased the region accessible to the cutting tool. However, in order to avoid thin webs and preserve tool life, cutting must be executed with a minimum of three orientations even for geometrically simple parts. Recent findings have suggested the separation of cutting orientations into roughing and finishing operations. Thus, the selection of orientations in finishing processes becomes more flexible and independent. This study was conducted to identify the effects of using a minimum of two cutting orientations in finishing operations for CNC-RM applications. This method is only applicable for non-complex parts where all the features can be machined from two directions. The results of the study illustrate the positive effects of minimizing the number of orientations.

This mold filling commercial software simulates the cavity filling pattern along with temperature and pressure distributions in the mold cavity. In the modeling, during the plastics flow inside the mold cavity, different flow parameters such as fill time, pressure, temperature, shear rate and warp at different locations in the cavity are analyzed.

However, the effect of the sputtering target's properties towards the thin film's properties is not well established. This study is focused on analysing the effect of sputtering target's grain size towards the sputtering yield, particle size and the magnetic coercivity (Hc) of thin film. Two sets of sputtering targets pure Ni (magnetic) and Ni20Al (at.%) (non-magnetic) were prepared. Each target has 2 sets of samples with different grain sizes (a) 30 to 50μm and (b) 80 to 100μm. Thin films from each target were sputtered onto glass substrates under fixed sputtering parameters. The initial results suggested that the sputtering target's grain size has significant effect on the thin film's sputtering yield, particle size and Hc. Sputtering target with smaller grain size has 12% (pure Ni) to 60% (Ni20Al) higher sputtering yield, which produces thin films with smaller particle size and larger Hc value.

In order to improve the efficiency of the TiO2, series of TiO2-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composites with various loading amounts of graphene oxide (GO), which were 0.5, 1, 3 and 5 wt% were prepared by UV- assisted photocatalytic reduction method. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra confirmed that all the TiO2-rGO composites samples were successfully synthesized without disrupting the structure of the TiO2. Fluorescence spectroscopy revealed the role of the rGO to reduce the electron-hole recombination on the TiO2, while the transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive X- ray spectroscopy (TEM-EDS) confirmed the morphology and the presence of both TiO2 and rGO. In the photocatalytic removal of phenol, all the TiO2-rGO composites showed better photocatalytic activities than the TiO2 under UV light irradiation. The activity of the TiO2 was enhanced by more than two times with the addition of the GO with the optimum amount (3 wt%).

The XRD pattern showed the presence of (002) plane at 2θ of 9.5o while the FTIR spectrum showed the presence of C-OH, C=O, C=C, C-O chemical bonds in the GO. The layer structure of the GO was confirmed from the TEM image.

Fluorescence quenching was observed, suggesting that the GO interacted well with both NO2- and NO3- ions. The linear Stern-Volmer plots were obtained in the concentration range of 1-10 mM, indicating the potential ability of the GO as the fluorescence sensor. The quenching constants for the detections of NO2- and NO3- were 4.8 10-2 and 1.2 10-2 mM-1, respectively, suggesting that the GO has greater sensitivity towards the NO2- than the NO3- ion. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is well-known as an active photocatalyst for degradation of various organic pollutants. Over the years, a wide range of TiO2 nanoparticles with different phase compositions, crystallinities, and surface areas have been developed. Due to the different methods and conditions used to synthesize these commercial TiO2 nanoparticles, the properties and photocatalytic performance would also be different from each other. In this study, the photocatalytic removal of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4,5- trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) was investigated on commercial Evonik P25, Evonik P90, Hombikat UV100 and Hombikat N100 TiO2 nanoparticles. Upon photocatalytic tests, it was found that overall, the photocatalytic activities of the P25 and the P90 were higher than the N100 and the UV100 for the removal of both 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. The high activities of the P25 and the P90 could be attributed to their phase compositions, which are made up of a mixture of anatase and rutile phases of TiO2. Whereas, the UV100 and the N100 are made up of 100% anatase phase of TiO2. The synergistic effect of the anatase/rutile mixture was reported to slow down the recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.

A series of CuO/TiO2 with CuO loadings of 0.1-1 wt% was prepared through a co-precipitation method. X-ray diffraction patterns revealed that the presence of CuO could not be detected as the low loading amount of CuO might have good dispersion on the surface of TiO2. Diffuse reflectance UV-visible spectra suggested that low loading amount of CuO did not influence the optical property of TiO2. Fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that TiO2 possessed a dominant emission peak of 407 nm at an excitation wavelength of 218 nm. The increasing loading amount of CuO decreased the emission intensity of TiO2, suggesting the successful reduction of charge recombination. After irradiation under UV light for 1 h, CuO(0.1 wt%)/TiO2 gave the highest percentage removal of the herbicide among the samples. The optimum loading amount of CuOmight improve the charge separation and reduce the electron-hole recombination on TiO2 without blocking the active sites, thus leading to the improved photocatalytic activity.

Maintaining and improving the cryogenic availability level required the implementation of a series of actions in order to deal with the observed heat loads. This paper describes the results from the process optimization and update of the control system, thus allowing the adjustment of the non-isothermal heat load at 4.5 - 20 K and the optimized dynamic behaviour of the cryogenic system versus the electron-cloud thermal load. Effects from the new regulation settings applied for operation on the electrical distribution feed-boxes and inner triplets will be discussed. The efficiency of the preventive and corrective maintenance, as well as the benefits and issues of the present cryogenic system configuration for Run 2 operational scenario will be described. Finally, the overall availability results and helium management of the LHC cryogenic system during the 2015-2016 operational period will be presented. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The cooling of the superconducting magnet cold masses with superfluid helium (He II) is a well-established concept successfully in operation for years in the LHC. Consequently, its application for the cooling of FCC magnets is an obvious option. The 12-kW heat loads distributed over 10-km long sectors not only require an adaption of the magnet bayonet heat exchangers but also present new challenges to the cryogenic plants, the distribution system and the control strategy. This paper recalls the basic LHC cooling concept with superfluid helium and defines the main parameters for the adaption to the FCC requirements. Pressure drop and hydrostatic head are developed in the distribution and pumping systems their impact on the magnet temperature profile and the corresponding cooling efficiency is presented and compared for different distribution and pumping schemes. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Helium cryogenic systems are extensively used at CERN under several configurations for accelerators and detectors. The Warm Compressor Station (WCS) is the primary component of the helium cryogenic systems.

These include fans, load haul dump units, and trucks. The motivating advantage is zero-emissions production in the subsurface and simultaneous provision of cooling for ultra deep mine workings. The driving force of the engine is the expansion of the reboiled cryogen following flash evaporation using ambient temperature heat. The cold exhaust mixes with warm mine air and cools the latter further. The use of cryogens as 'fuel' leads to much increased fuel transport volumes and motivates special considerations for distribution infrastructure and process including: cryogenic storage, distribution, handling, and transfer systems. Detailed specification of parts and equipment, numerical modelling and preparation of design drawings are used to articulate the concept. The conceptual design process reveals new hazards and risks that the mining industry has not yet encountered, which may yet stymie execution. The major unwanted events include the potential for asphyxiation due to oxygen deficient atmospheres, or physical damage to workers due to exposure to sub-cooled liquids and cryogenic gases. The Global Minerals Industry Risk Management (GMIRM) framework incorporates WRAC and Bow-Tie techniques and is used to identify, assess and mitigate risks. These processes operate upon the competing conceptual designs to identify and eliminate high risk options and improve the safety of the lower risk designs. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'Zeotropic mixtures never have the same liquid and vapor composition in the liquid-vapor equilibrium. Also, the bubble and the dew point are separated this gap is called glide temperature (Tglide). Those characteristics have made these mixtures suitable for cryogenics Joule-Thomson (JT) refrigeration cycles. Zeotropic mixtures as working fluid in JT cycles improve their performance in an order of magnitude. Optimization of JT cycles have earned substantial importance for cryogenics applications (e.g, gas liquefaction, cryosurgery probes, cooling of infrared sensors, cryopreservation, and biomedical samples). Heat exchangers design on those cycles is a critical point consequently, heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop of two-phase zeotropic mixtures are relevant. In this work, it will be applied a methodology in order to calculate the local convective heat transfer coefficients based on the law of the wall approach for turbulent flows. The flow and heat transfer characteristics of zeotropic mixtures in a heated horizontal tube are investigated numerically. The temperature profile and heat transfer coefficient for zeotropic mixtures of different bulk compositions are analysed. The numerical model has been developed and locally applied in a fully developed, constant temperature wall, and two-phase annular flow in a duct. Numerical results have been obtained using this model taking into account continuity, momentum, and energy equations. Local heat transfer coefficient results are compared with available experimental data published by Barraza et al.

Currently, coolants such as solid carbon dioxide and liquid nitrogen are used to preserve good morphology of the tissue. Using these coolants, snap freezing of tissues for diagnostic and research purposes is often time consuming, laborious, even hazardous and not user friendly. For that reason snap-freezing is not routinely applied at the location of biopsy acquisition. Furthermore, the influence of optimal cooling rate and cold sink temperature on the viability of the cells is not well known. In this paper, a snap-freezing apparatus powered by a small cryocooler is presented that will allow bio-medical research of tissue freezing methods and is safe to use in a hospital. To benchmark this apparatus, cooldown of a standard aluminum cryo-vial in liquid nitrogen is measured and the cooling rate is about -25 K/s between 295 K and 120 K. Sufficient cooling rate is obtained by a forced convective helium gas flow through a gap formed between the cryo-vial and a cold surface and is therefore chosen as the preferred cooling method. A conceptual design of the snap-apparatus with forced flow is discussed in this paper. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The large-scale liquid argon Short Baseline Neutrino Far-detector located at Fermilab is designed to detect neutrinos allowing research in the field of neutrino oscillations. It will be filled with liquid argon and operate at almost ambient pressure. Consequently, its operation temperature is determined at about 87 K. The detector will be surrounded by a thermal shield, which is actively cooled with boiling nitrogen at a pressure of about 2.8 bar absolute, the respective saturation pressure of nitrogen. Due to strict temperature gradient constraints, it is important to study the two-phase flow pressure drop of nitrogen along the cooling circuit of the thermal shield in different orientations of the flow with respect to gravity. An experimental setup has been built in order to determine the two-phase flow pressure drop in nitrogen in horizontal, vertical upward and vertical downward direction. The measurements have been conducted under quasi-adiabatic conditions and at a saturation pressure of 2.8 bar absolute. The mass velocity has been varied in the range of 20 kg•m-2•s-1 to 70 kg•m-2•s-1 and the pressure drop data has been recorded scanning the two-phase region from vapor qualities close to zero up to 0.7.

The consequence, in the case of a rupture of the envelopes, may be serious for personnel (injuries from deflagration, burns, and oxygen deficiency hazard) as well as for the equipment. Performing a thorough risk analysis is an essential step to identify and understand risk hazards that may cause a pressure increase and in order to assess consequences, define mitigation actions, and design adequate safety relief devices to limit pressure accordingly.

A pulse-tube cryocooler recondenses evaporated helium to liquid at 4.2 K filling the helium vessel of the cryostat at an equivalent cooling power of 0.69 W. To reduce the transmission of vibration to the highly sensitive CCC, the titanium support systems of the cryostat were optimized to be as stiff as possible while limiting the transmission of heat to the liquid helium vessel. During operation the liquid helium level in the cryostat was seen to reduce, indicating that heat load was higher than intended. To verify the reason for this additional heat load and improve the cryogenic performance of the cryostat, an upgrade was undertaken during the 2016 technical stop of the AD. This article presents the studies undertaken to understand the thermal performance of the cryostat and details the improvements made to reduce heat load on the liquid helium vessel. Also discussed are the procedures used to reduce the diffusion of helium to the vacuum space through ceramic insulators.

This paper assesses the refrigeration duty of the eight existing plants considering the modified sectorisation and increased heat load deposition. The accelerator loads and distribution losses are quantified for each plant and compared to the existing refrigeration capacity.

The WE mechanism included a phase shifting piston suspended on a silicone diaphragm, a mass element, and a viscous damping system. Several technical drawbacks prevented perfect matching between the WE and MTSa however, the presented prototype proved the ability to create any flow-to-pressure phase appropriate for a PT cryocooler.

In this study, the nonconventional processes of electrical discharge machining (EDM) and electro-polishing (EP) have been conducted to investigate the machining of Mo metal and fabrication of Mo grid. Satisfactory surface quality was obtained using appropriate EDM parameters of Ip ≦ 3A and Ton &lt 80μs at a constant pulse interval of 100μs. The finished Mometal has accomplished by selecting appropriate EP parameters such as electrolyte flow rate of 0.42m/s under EP voltage of 50V and flush time of 20 sec to remove the recast layer and craters on the surface of Mo metal. The surface roughness of machined Mo metal can be improved from Ra of 0.93μm (Rmax = 8.51μm) to 0.23μm (Rmax = 1.48μm). Machined Mo metal surface, when used as grid component in electron gun, needs to be modified by coating materials with high work function, such as silicon carbide (SiC). The main purpose of this study is to explore the electrical discharge coating (EDC) process for coating the SiC layer on EDMed Mo metal. Experimental results proved that the appropriate parameters of Ip = 5A and Ton = 50μs at Toff = 10μs can obtain the deposit with about 60μm thickness. The major phase of deposit on machined Mo surface was SiC ceramic, while the minor phases included MoSi2 and/or SiO2 with the presence of free Si due to improper discharging parameters and the use of silicone oil as the dielectric fluid. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The goal of this study was to investigate the optimal variables settings in internal grinding for shrink fit tool holder.

The main process variables such as abrasive grain size (AGS), grinding wheel speed (GWS), feed rate for rough (FRR), depth for rough (DR), feed rate for finishing (FRF), depth for finishing (DF), dressing speed (DS), and workpiece rotational speed (WRS) were chosen to determine their effects on grinding performances related to roundness and surface roughness in the internal grinding of the shrink fit tool holder. The experimental response values were transferred to signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios, and then the significant process variables associated with the grinding performance were examined by analysis of variance (ANOVA). In addition, the optimal combination levels of the grinding variables were also obtained from the response graphs of S/N ratios to improve the surface quality of internal grinding. The experimental results show that the significant grinding variable affecting the roundness was FRF. In addition, the significant variables with regard to surface roughness were AGS, GWS, FRR, DR, DF, and DS. The optimal grinding variable settings were achieved.

Sensible heat transfer is considered in the analysis and the heat exchanger is developed for actual operating conditions in a chemical plant. The heat exchanger is a concentric tube heat exchanger where hot oil exchanges heat with hot water. Hot oil is in the inner pipe and the heating medium, hot water, is in the outer pipe (annular side) of the heat exchanger. An analytical model employing effectiveness-number of transfer units (ϵ-NTU) approach and log mean temperature difference (LMTD) approach were employed in the design of the concentric tube heat exchanger. In the design process, performance charts were developed for concentric tube heat exchanger. Performance charts describe the performance of the heat exchanger in terms of crucial dimensionless parameters. Performance charts help to select the right number of transfer units (NTU) for the given heat exchanger. Both parallel and counter flow configurations were considered for the design analysis. Likewise, a numerical model was also considered in the design of the heat exchanger. The results from the analysis are presented and compared. From the results it can be seen that both numerical and analytical approaches produce the exact same results.

The design approach of MEA often results to simple solid solution with either body centered cubic face centered cubic structures or both. As the consideration for introducing the alloys into several engineering application increases, there have been efforts to study the corrosion behaviour of these alloys. Previous reports have shown that some of these alloys are more susceptible to corrosion when compared with traditional alloys due to lack of protective passive film. In this research, we have developed AlFeTiV medium entropy alloys containing two elements (Ti and Al) that readily passivate when exposed to corrosive solutions. The alloys were produced in vacuum arc furnace purged with high purity argon. Open circuit potential and potentiodynamic polarisation tests were used to evaluate the corrosion behaviour of the as-cast AlFeTiV alloy in 3.5 wt% NaCl and 1 M H2SO4. The corrosion performance of the alloy was compared with Ti-6Al-4V alloy tested under similar conditions. The results show that unlike in Ti-6Al-4V alloy, the open circuit potential of the AlFeTiV alloy move towards the negative values in both 3.5 wt% NaCl and 1 M H2SO4 solutions indicating that self-activation occurred rapidly on immersion. Anodic polarisation of the alloys showed that AlFeTiV alloy exhibited a narrow range of passivity in both solutions. In addition, the alloys exhibited lower Ecorr and higher Icorr when compared with traditional Ti-6Al-4V alloy.

High speed camera was used for analysis with 100 images per second. General combustion behavior of gel droplet were observed such as swelling, micro explosion, and vapor jetting. It was confirmed that ignition did not occur at 500°C.

This CPM is synthesized using the beam-based method, a new structural optimization approach, to achieve optimized stiffness properties with targeted dynamic behavior. The CPM performs high non-actuating stiffness based on the predicted stiffness ratios of about 3600 for translations and 570 for rotations, while the dynamic response is fast with the targeted first resonant mode of 100Hz. A prototype of the synthesized CPM is fabricated using the electron beam melting (EBM) technology with Ti6Al4V material. Driven by three voice-coil (VC) motors, the CPM demonstrated a positioning resolution of 50nm along the Z axis and an angular resolution of ∼0.3 \"about the X and Y axes, the positioning accuracy is also good with the measured values of ±25.2nm and ±0.17\" for the translation and rotations respectively. Experimental investigation also shows that this large workspace CPM has a first resonant mode of 98Hz and the stiffness behavior matches the prediction with the highest deviation of 11.2%. Most importantly, the full workspace of 10° × 10° × 7mm of the proposed CPM can be achieved, that demonstrates 3D printed compliant mechanisms can perform large elastic deformation. The obtained results show that CPMs printed by EBM technology have predictable mechanical characteristics and are applicable in precise positioning systems. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'A Separator is a device installed in industrial applications to separate mixed objects. The separator of interest in this research is a cyclone type, which is used to separate a steam-brine mixture in a geothermal plant. The most important performance of the cyclone separator is the collection efficiency. The collection efficiency in this study is predicted by performing the CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) analysis. This research defines six shape design variables to maximize the collection efficiency. Thus, the collection efficiency is set up as the objective function in optimization process. Since the CFD analysis requires a lot of calculation time, it is impossible to obtain the optimal solution by linking the gradient-based optimization algorithm. Thus, two approximation methods are introduced to obtain an optimum design. In this process, an L18 orthogonal array is adopted as a DOE method, and kriging interpolation method is adopted to generate the metamodel for the collection efficiency. Based on the 18 analysis results, the relative importance of each variable to the collection efficiency is obtained through the ANOVA (analysis of variance). The final design is suggested considering the results obtained from two optimization methods. The fluid flow analysis of the cyclone separator is conducted by using the commercial CFD software, ANSYS-CFX. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"Traditionally, the mechanism of wheelchair with lifting and standing functions has 2 degrees of freedom, and used 2 power sources to perform these 2 motion function.

Both the prototype thermal reactor and its modifications, including changing fuel mass fraction, changing inlet air quantity, changing inlet oxygen mole fraction, and changing burner geometry, are analyzed to investigate their influences on NOx emissions. In respect of the fuel mass fraction, the simulation results show that the highest NO emission occurs at a zone 1 fuel mass fraction of 0.375, around which the reactor maximum temperature and the zone 1 average temperature reach maximum values. Concerning the inlet air quantity, the highest NO emission occurs when the inlet air quantity is 2.4 times the designed inlet air quantity. This is very close to the inlet air quantity at which the maximum average temperature occurs. Regarding the inlet oxygen mole fraction, the NO emission increases as the inlet oxygen mole fraction increases.

Offshore installations, in particular, are susceptible to fatigue failure due to their exposure to the combination of wind loads, wave loads and currents.

In this work, we have investigated the capability of a FSI toolkit for the finite volume computational fluid dynamics software foam-extend to simulate turbulence-induced vibrations of a flexible structure. A large-eddy simulation (LES) turbulence model has been implemented to a basic FSI problem of a flexible wall which is placed in a confined, turbulent flow. This problem was simulated for 2.32 seconds. This short simulation required over 200 computation hours, using 20 processor cores. Thereby, it has been shown that the simulation of FSI with LES is possible, but also computationally demanding. In order to make turbulent FSI simulations with foam-extend more applicable, more sophisticated turbulence models and/or faster FSI iteration schemes should be applied.',\n"," 'Structures exposed to aggressive environmental conditions are often subjected to time-dependent loss of coating and loss of material due to corrosion this causes reduction in the cross-sectional properties of the members, increased surface roughness, surface irregularities and corrosion pits, and degradation of material strengths. These effects have been identified and simulated in different research studies. However, time and corrosive media dependent fatigue strength curves for materials have not been discussed in the design or assessment guidelines for structures. This paper attempts to review the corrosion degradation process and available approaches/models used to determine the fatigue strength of corroded materials and to interpolate corrosion deterioration data. High cycle fatigue and full range fatigue life formulae for fatigue strength of corroded materials are proposed. The above formulae depend on the endurance limit of corroded material, in addition to the stress-life fatigue curve parameters of the uncorroded material. The endurance limit of corroded material can either be determined by a limited number of tests in the very high-cycle fatigue region or predicted by an analytical approach. Comparison with experimentally measured corrosion fatigue behavior of several materials is provided and discussed.',\n"," 'An overview of integrity management of offshore structures, with emphasis on the oil and gas energy sector, is given.

Earlier developments of topology optimization considered conventional manufacturing techniques that have limitations in producing complex geometries. This has hindered the topology optimization efforts not to fully be realized.

This process is geometrically nonlinear, therefore co-rotational beam elements are used. The pipe is subject to static and dynamic forces. Static forces are due to gravity, current and buoyancy. The dynamic forces exerted by the water are incorporated using Morison's equation. The dynamic motions are computed using implicit time integration. For this the Hilber-Hughes-Taylor method is selected. The Newton-Raphson iteration scheme is used to solve the equations in every time step.

Current applications of the technology are mainly limited to energy storage for power plants using large scale underground caverns. This paper explores the possibility of making use of reinforced concrete pile foundations to store renewable energy generated from solar panels or windmills attached to building structures. The energy will be stored inside the pile foundation with hollow sections via compressed air. Given the relatively small volume of storage provided by the foundation, the required storage pressure is expected to be higher than that in the large-scale underground cavern. The high air pressure typically associated with large temperature increase, combined with structural loads, will make the pile foundation in a complicated loading condition, which might cause issues in the structural and geotechnical safety. This paper presents a preliminary analytical study on the performance of the pile foundation subjected to high pressure, large temperature increase and structural loads. Finite element analyses on pile foundation models, which are built from selected prototype structures, have been conducted. The analytical study identifies maximum stresses in the concrete of the pile foundation under combined pressure, temperature change and structural loads. Recommendations have been made for the use of reinforced concrete pile foundations for renewable energy storage. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Shortage and delay in materials supply is argued to be one of the most important factors that lead to delay in construction project delivery globally. However, the relevant underlying reasons vary from country to country. As such, this paper summarises the outcomes of a study that targeted identifying causes of shortage and delay in materials supply in Brunei Darussalam. The study was conducted through fifteen semi-structured interviews of contractors and materials suppliers in Brunei. The study identified six causes of shortageof materials and nine causes of delay in materials supply in Brunei. The most importantcausefor shortage of materials relates to the origin or availability of construction materials. On the other hand, the most influential cause of delay in material supply was found to be poor materials procurement and inventory management system, which has other underlying reasons such as late identification of the type of materials needed.

The study looks at the strength properties, such as compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and elastic modulus of such concretes and its dependency on various parameters. The parameters studied in this work are the type and proportions of pre-cursor materials, type of activator and their respective ratios and the curing time. Two types of pre-cursor material low calcium fly ash (FA) and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) were activated using different proportions of sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide solutions. The results indicate that ambient cured geopolymer concrete can be manufactured to match strength properties of ordinary Portland cement concrete (OPC). The strength properties of GPC are dependent on the type and ratio of activator and the proportion of GGBFS used. Increasing the percentage of GGBFS increased the compressive and tensile strengths, while reducing the setting time of the mix. The effect of GGBFS on strength was more pronounced in mixes that contained sodium silicate as activator solution. Unlike OPC, ambient-cured GPC containing sodium silicate gain most of their strength in the first 7 days and there is no change in strength thereafter. However, GPC mixes not containing sodium silicate only achieve a fraction of their strength at 7 days and extended curing is required for such concretes to gain full strength. The results also indicate that the elastic modulus values of GPC mixes without sodium silicate are comparable to OPC while mixes with sodium silicate have elastic modulus values much lower than ordinary concrete.',\n"," 'A large amount of plate jigs is used for alignment of welding line and control of welding deformations in hull block assembly stage.

Even when the technology is the same, the use of different materials, structures, colours, etc. creates various unique surfaces. The method used in the presented research was a style matrix which is developed from the axiomatic system. Only the part dealing with the language of fine arts and the pictorial speech - the style of a certain designer and a certain work of art/knitted fabric was used. After the selected three designers were examined through all the periods, it was concluded that each designer can be characterised by his own style. Despite the influencing fashion trends, all the compared designers still retained their own style, their own techniques, their own inspirations. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The Fabric Touch Tester (FTT) is a relatively new instrument that simultaneously measures several fabric indices and subsequently compute from them primary and global comfort indices (fabric total touch and total feel). The main aim of this research was to investigate the ability of the FTT to discriminate between primary comfort indices of fabrics differentiated by yarn type (i.e. ring-spun yarns and air-jet yarns) and finishing treatments. Polyester-cotton knitted fabrics were produced and their FTT-predicted primary comfort indices (i.e. smoothness, softness and warmth) were compared with those of the finished knits (i.e. dyed and dyed with softening treatments). For the considered fabrics, it was fond that the type of yarn did not lead to statistically significant different comfort indices. Nevertheless, significant differences were found between the comfort indices of the untreated fabrics and the fabrics dyed and treated with a softener regardless the type of yarn. The findings are in line with similar findings from literature where other instruments were used. These first results suggest that FTT is a promising tool that is able to distinguish between samples with small differences induced by finishing treatments. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'For some time design of a new product is not connected only with aesthetic, artistic appearance but moreover with functionality and engineering (from rightful selection of materials, construction, and technological concept to prototyping).

Hydrophilic fibres are easy-wash materials but hydrophobic fibres are difficult to clean due to their higher water-repellent surfaces. This type of surfaces, like polyester (PET), produce an accumulation of electrostatic charges, which favors adsorption and retention of dirt. Thus, the polyester soil-release properties can be increased by finishing processes that improve fiber hydrophilicity.

The use of normalised strain energy for product benchmarking is demonstrated along with comfort level determination through strain energy density stratification. Sensitivity of strain energy against material thickness is greater for bending than for torsion, with results of both deformations showing positive correlation. Optimization for a targeted performance level and given layer thickness is demonstrated with bending simulations sufficing for overall comfort assessment.

Thus a study of their electro-physical characteristics, character of conductivity, possibility of forecasting of electric parameters etc has a substantial value. This work shows the possibility of production electro-conducting textile materials with stable anti-static properties by introduction of electro-conducting yarn into the structure of fabrics. The results of the research, directed to the study of the electro-physical characteristics of electroconducting yarn and fabrics, are influenced by the frequent washing of polyester fabrics containing the different amounts of electro-conducting filaments in the composition.

The carbon footprint measures the total amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions produced directly and indirectly by human activities and is usually expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalents. The present study takes into account data collected in scientific literature regarding the carbon footprint, garments produced with silk fiber and the role of mulberry as a CO2 mitigation tool. There is an indication of a positive correlation between silk garments and carbon footprint mitigation when computed the cultivation of mulberry trees in this calculation. A field of them mitigates CO2 equivalents in a proportion of 735 times the weight of the produced silk fiber by the mulberry cultivated area. At the same time, additional researches are needed in order to identify and evaluate methods to advertise this positive correlation in order to contribute to a more sustainable fashion industry. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"Nowadays the majority of textile industries are not able to characterize or to study the process of adhering the microcapsule to the fibre's surface.

Chemical modification of cotton fabric was achieved by covalent attachment of a bifunctional linker molecule to the surface of the fabric, followed by incorporation of a monomer unit onto the linker. The fabrics were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron spectroscopy, and thermal analysis. Furthermore, the effect of Py concentration on the degree of polypyrrole (PPy) grafting, surface morphology, electrical resistivity, and laundering durability were studied for both types of cotton fabrics. Reductions of several orders of magnitude in surface and volume electrical resistivities were observed for both non-covalently and covalently linked cotton-PPy systems, whereas the effect of covalent pre-treatment of the fabric was stronger at low Py concentration. On the other hand, at higher monomer concentration, the electrical properties and laundering durability of the fabrics we comparable for both unmodified and chemically pre-treated cotton fabrics, indicating that only a small fraction of PPy chains were chemically grafted onto the fabric surface with the majority of the polymer being connected to the fabric through hydrogen bonds.',\n"," 'Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) atmospheric-pressure plasma was employed to enhance the deposition of commercial microcapsules (MCs) containing Aloe vera extract onto a cotton/polyester (50:50) fabric. DBD conditions were optimized in term of energy dosage and contact angle. The MCs were applied by padding and printing methods and the coatings were characterized in terms of SEM and FTIR. MCs display a spherical shape with size between 2 and 8 μm with an average wall thickness of 0.5 μm. The MCs applied by printing and pretreated with a plasma dosage of 1.6 kW m2 min-1 showed the best results with an increased adhesion of 200% and significant penetration of MCs into the fibres network. Plasma printed fabric retained 230% more MCs than untreated fabric after 10 washing cycles. However, the coating resistance between unwashed and washed samples was only improved by 5%. Considering the fact that no binder or crosslinking agents were used, the DBD plasma-assisted deposition of MCs revealed to be a promising environmental safe and low cost coating technology. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Concrete is generally the most used material in the field of construction. Despite its extensive use in structures, it represents some drawbacks related to its properties including its low tensile strength and low ductility. To solve this problem, the use of steel reinforcement in concrete structures is possible. Another possibility is the introduction of different types of continuous fibre / staple in the concrete, such as steel fibres or synthetic fibres, to obtain ″Concretes bundles″. Many types of fibre concrete, which have been developed and for many of them, the gain provided by the fibre was rather low and no significant improvement in tensile strength was really reaching. By cons, the ductility was higher than that of ordinary concrete. The objective of this study is to examine concrete reinforcement by inserting reinforcements woven polyester. These are either woven bidirectional (2D) or three-dimensional woven (3D). So we will report the properties of each type of reinforcement and the influence of the method of weaving on the strength reinforcements and on the strength of concrete in which they are incorporated. Such influence should contribute to improving the sustainability and enhancement of reinforcement. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Microcapsules with a pressure-sensitive melamine-formaldehyde wall and triclosan core were printed to 100% cotton fabric with screen printing technique.

As the quality of images decreases with lowering the X-ray radiation dose, improving image quality is extremely important and challenging. We have proposed a novel approach to denoise low-dose CT images. Our algorithm learns directly from an end-to-end mapping from the low-dose Computed Tomography images for denoising the normal-dose CT images. Our method is based on a deep convolutional neural network with rectified linear units. By learning various low-level to high-level features from a low-dose image the proposed algorithm is capable of creating a high-quality denoised image. We demonstrate the superiority of our technique by comparing the results with two other state-of-the-art methods in terms of the peak signal to noise ratio, root mean square error, and a structural similarity index. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The paper deals with the changing of the traditional roofs in the city of Košice into green roofs.

It is the above all the building envelope and its refurbishment by substitution or addition of new materials that makes the opportunity for reduction of energy consumption. A special type of refurbishment is conservation of historical buildings. Preservation of historic buildings permits also application of innovative methods and materials in addition to the original materials if their effects are known and the gained experience ensures their beneficial effect. On the market, there are new materials with addition of silica aerogel in various forms of products. They are also potentially useful in conservation of monuments. However, the effects of aerogel application in these cases are not known. For refurbishment is commercially available additional transparent insulation paint - Nansulate Clear Coat which is containing aerogel and can be used for structured surfaces such as bricks. A series of experiments examined the thermo-physical manifestation of an ultra-thin insulation coating of Nansulate Clear Coat containing silica aerogel on a brick facade. The experiments of active and passive thermography have observed effects of application on the small-scale samples of the brick façade of a protected historical building. Through a series of experiments were measured thermal insulation effect and influence on the aesthetic characteristics such as change in colour and gloss. The treated samples were compared to a reference. Results have shown no thermal-insulating manifestation of the recommended three layers of insulation paint. The three layers recommended by the manufacturer did not significantly affect the appearance of the brick facade. Color and gloss were not significantly changed. Experiments showed the absence of thermal insulation effect of Nansulate transparent triple coating. The thermal insulation effect could likely be reached by more layers of application, which, on the other hand may be unacceptable on the heritage conservation because of number of applications, time demand and financial costs. The effects of multiple layers on heritage attributes were not researched. Extrapolating the measured results, it can be expected that application of more than three layers of paint can significantly affect the aesthetic characteristics of the monument such as gloss and colours of historic brick facades. Due to specific material consistence of historic architecture and new insulation paint materials on the market, it is recommended to provide independent laboratory testing and on-site tests on facades of historic buildings in cooperation with the Monument Protection Board. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'A newly constructed passive house must save 80 % of heat resources otherwise it is not a passive house. The heating energy demand of a passive building is less than 15 kWh/m2 per year. However, a passive house is something more than just an energy-saving house. This concept involves sustainable, high-quality, valuable, healthy and durable construction. Features of a passive house: high insulation of envelope components, high-quality windows, good tightness of the building, regenerative ventilation system and elimination of thermal bridges. The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) 61 requires all new public buildings to become near-zero energy buildings by 2019 and will be extended to all new buildings by 2021. This concept involves sustainable, high-quality, valuable, healthy and durable construction. Foundation, walls and roofs are the most essential elements of a house. The type of foundation for a private house is selected considering many factors. The article examines technological and structural solutions for passive buildings foundation, walls and roofs. The technical-economic comparison of the main structures of a passive house revealed that it is cheaper to install an adequately designed concrete slab foundation than to build strip or pile foundation and the floor separately. Timber stud walls are the cheapest wall option for a passive house and 45-51% cheaper compared to other options. The comparison of roofs and ceilings showed that insulation of the ceiling is 25% more efficient than insulation of the roof. The comparison of the main envelope elements efficiency by multiple-criteria evaluation methods showed that it is economically feasible to install concrete slab on ground foundation, stud walls with sheet cladding and a pitched roof with insulated ceiling. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The problem of schedule delay commonly occurs in construction projects. The quality of delay analysis depends on the availability of schedule-related information and delay evidence. More information used in delay analysis usually produces more accurate and fair analytical results. How to use innovative techniques to improve the quality of schedule delay analysis results have received much attention recently. As Building Information Modeling (BIM) technique has been quickly developed, using BIM and 4D simulation techniques have been proposed and implemented. Obvious benefits have been achieved especially in identifying and solving construction consequence problems in advance of construction. This study preforms an intensive literature review to discuss the problems encountered in schedule delay analysis and the possibility of using BIM as a tool in developing a BIM-based approach for schedule delay analysis. This study believes that most of the identified problems can be dealt with by BIM technique.

Given that an exercise with traditional procedures can be solved, detailed step by step in technical drawing and descriptive geometry manuals, CAD applications allow us to do the same and generalize it later, incorporating references. Traditional teachings have become obsolete and current curricula have been relegated. However, they can be applied in certain automation processes. The use of geometric references (using variables in script languages) and their incorporation into HLCts allows the automation of drawing processes. Instead of repeatedly creating similar exercises or modifying data in the same exercises, users should be able to use HLCts to generate future modifications of these exercises. This paper introduces the automation process when generating exercises based on CAD script files, aided by parametric geometry calculation tools. The proposed method allows us to design new exercises without user intervention. The integration of CAD, mathematics, and descriptive geometry facilitates their joint learning. Automation in the generation of exercises not only saves time but also increases the quality of the statements and reduces the possibility of human error. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'In member states of the European Union, portion of buildings in the total consumption of energy represents 40 %, and their share in CO2 emissions represents 35 %. Taking into account the dependence of the European Union on import of energy, this represents a large quantity of energy and CO2 in spite of the fact that effective solutions for the reduction of energy demand of buildings exist. The European Union adopted three main commitments for fulfilment of criteria by year 2020 in the 20-20-20 Directive. Based on this Directive Slovakia declares support for renovating the building stock. The goal of the paper was to prove that renovation of the building stock is environmentally and energy preferably as construction of new buildings. In the paper, the settlement unit with the suburban one were compared. Both territories are dealt with in Kosice city, in Slovakia. The settlement units include apartment dwelling houses, amenities, parking areas and green. Suburban part contains family houses. The decisive factor for the final assessment of the buildings was global indicator. Global indicator of the energy performance is primary energy. The new building must meet minimum requirements for energy performance and it must be classified to energy class A1 since 2016, and to energy class A0 since 2020. The paper analyses the effects of the use of different resources of heat considering the global indicator. Primary energy was calculated and based on comparable unit. The primary energy was accounted for on the built-up area, area corresponding to district city and suburb, number of inhabitants. The study shows that the lowest values of global indicator are achieved by using wood. The highest values of global indicator are achieved by using electricity or district heating as an energy source. The difference between the highest and lowest value is 87 %. Primary energy based on inhabitant is 98 % lower in settlement unit compared to the suburban one. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The well-being of people living in cities is strongly dependent on the existence of urban vegetation because of the ecosystem services or benefits it provides. This is why governments develop plans to create green spaces, plant trees, promote the maintenance of vegetation in private spaces and also monitor their status over time. In Latin America, and particularly in Chile, the increase of urban vegetation has been stimulated through different initiatives and regulations. However, development of monitoring programs at the national level is scarce, so it is yet unknown if these initiatives and regulations have had positive effects. In this article, we monitor the change in urban vegetation in 13 Chilean cities located in a latitudinal gradient of practically zero to almost 1800 mm of annual rainfall. We calculated the trends in NDVI (2000-2016) as an indicator of change in urban greenery using data from the MODIS Subsets platform. Likewise, to assess whether the initiatives have had an effect we quantified the number of urban parks existing at the beginning of the period and how many were created during the study period. For this, we analysed official databases and high spatial resolution satellite images. Armed with said data, we assessed whether these new parks had impacted the tendency toward change in urban greenery. The results indicate that, in general, Chilean cities vary greatly inter-annually in urban greenery and have lost urban vegetation in the last 16 years, with significant losses in four of those cities. Two cities located in desert ecosystems represent an exception and showed positive trends in their urban vegetation. The rainfall in cities has an impact on the amount of vegetation, but not on their tendency to change, i.e. there are cities with loss of vegetation at all levels of precipitation. The creation of parks has not been able to reverse negative trends, which indicates the prevalence of other drivers of change that are not sufficiently compensated by initiatives and regulations that seek to increase urban vegetation. Today, planning and management of urban vegetation is a challenge for urban sustainability and must be addressed systematically, integrally and implemented via urban regulations. It is imperative to focus on cities in extenso, taking into consideration residential areas, private spaces, peri-urban areas, etc. Likewise, climate in each city, inter-annual variability and future changes must also be considered when designing green areas to make them resilient, prevent increases in maintenance costs and provide benefits for the inhabitants in perpetuity. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Requirements for properties of bituminous binders are determined in the European standards. The physico-chemical behaviour of bitumen depends on its colloidal structure (asphaltenes dispersed into an oily matrix constituted by saturates, aromatics and resins) that depends primarily on its crude source and processing. Bitumen properties are evaluated by group composition, elementary analysis, but more often conventional or functional tests. Bitumen for road uses is assessed according to the physical characteristics. For the purpose of improving the qualitative properties of bitumen and asphalts the additives are applied e.g. to increase elasticity, improving the heat stability, improving adhesion to aggregate, to decrease viscosity, increasing the resistance to aging, to prevent binder drainage from the aggregate surface, etc. The objective of presented paper is to assess and compare effect of additives on properties of bitumen binders. In paper, the results of bitumen properties, penetration, softening point, and dynamic viscosity of two paving grade bitumen 35/50, 50/70 and polymer modified bitumen PmB 45/80-75 are analyzed and also the changes of these properties by the application of selected additives (Sasobit, Licomont BS100, Wetfix BE and CWM) to improve adhesion to aggregate and improve workability. Measurements of properties have been performed according to the relevant European standards. The laboratory tests showed significantly increasing the softening point of paving grade bitumen 50/70 and 35/50 by 13 to 45°C. The effect of various additives on bitumen softening point is different. Penetration varies according to type of bitumen and type of used additive. The penetration values of modified bitumen PmB 45/80-75 with additives Sasobit and Licomont BS100 show increase of bitumen stiffness of 16 0.1mm and a shift in the gradation. The changes in penetration and in softening point significantly shown when calculating on Penetration index as a parameter of temperature susceptibility. The additives changed the viscosity of bitumen to lower values mostly with modified bitumen. In case of the additive Wetfix BE mix in 35/50caused the viscosity increase. The additive changes the properties of original bituminous binders, and that can affect the properties of asphalt mixtures and asphalt layers. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'In Korea, defect lawsuits for apartment buildings, the most common housing style, are becoming a social issue. Among various issues in defect lawsuits, warranty of liability is very important. This is because the business entities are responsible for assuring the maintenance of the defects during this period, and at the same time, the residents can request fair compensation for the defects. However, provisions on the term of warranty of liability provided in the current Housing Act were made 40 years ago when the social basis were weak. Thus, it does not have any rational foundation. In order to improve these problems, basic research on the warranty of liability by major types of apartments is needed. In this study, the defect cases for miscellaneous works of apartments were examined and analyzed. Miscellaneous work consists of ondol work, kitchenware work, indoor and outdoor equipment work, and metallic work. Among them, kitchenware work and metallic work showed a lot of defects. On the other hand, warranty of liability covers up to 10 years in total. The defect occurrence for the entire miscellaneous work showed a tendency to concentrate in the first and the second year. It is the third year that the total defects reach 95%, and the fourth year that exceeds 99%. The ondol work, indoor and outdoor equipment work and metallic work had this tendency. On the other hand, for kitchenware work, it is the third year that the defect occurrence reaches 99%, and it implies that the defect tends to occur more quickly than in other detailed works. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'World is changing dramatically.

Ratio between a real available soil water storage and a potential available soil water storage was specified. Amount of potential available soil water storage was derived by retention curves of soil samples. Map of risk areas was created in GIS in pursuance of these calculations. We can see the negative trends of available soil water storage in years 2015 and 2016. Main addition of this paper is a selection of areas where soil moisture is a limiting factor of agriculture.

The economic costs of a landslide disaster include relocation of communities and physical repair of urban infrastructure. However, when performing a quantitative risk analysis, generally, the indirect economic consequences of such an event are not taken into account. A probabilistic approach methodology that considers several scenarios of hazard and vulnerability to measure the magnitude of the landslide and to quantify the economic costs is proposed. With this approach, it is possible to carry out a quantitative evaluation of the risk by landslides, allowing the calculation of the economic losses before a potential disaster in an objective, standardized and reproducible way, taking into account the uncertainty of the building costs in the study zone. The possibility of comparing different scenarios facilitates the urban planning process, the optimization of interventions to reduce risk to acceptable levels and an assessment of economic losses according to the magnitude of the damage. For the development and explanation of the proposed methodology, a simple case study is presented, located in north-eastern zone of the city of Medellín. This area has particular geomorphological characteristics, and it is also characterized by the presence of several buildings in bad structural conditions. The proposed methodology permits to obtain an estimative of the probable economic losses by earthquake-induced landslides, taking into account the uncertainty of the building costs in the study zone. The obtained estimative shows that the structural intervention of the buildings produces a reduction the order of 21 % in the total landslide risk. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"The guidelines for urban design in Izola's IPA-8 planning area, which is earmarked for hotels, apartment complexes, and sports, specify diverse forms of leisure living space required by modern society.

The load from the vehicle is transferred to the pavement structure through contact area of the tires. Experimental studies show nonuniform distribution of the pressure in the area. This non-uniformity is caused by the flexible nature and the shape of the tire and is influenced by the tire inflation. Several tire load patterns, including uniform distribution and point load, were involved in the numerical modelling using finite element method. Applied tire loads were based on the tire contact forces of the lorry Tatra 815. There were selected two procedures for the calculations. The first one was based on the simplification of the vehicle to the half-part model. The characteristics of the vehicle model were verified by the experiment and by the numerical model in the software ADINA, when vehicle behaviour during the ride was investigated. Second step involved application of the calculated contact forces for the front axle as the load on the multi-layered half space representing the pavement structure. This procedure was realized in the software Plaxis and considered various stress patterns for the load. The response of the ground to the vehicle load was then analyzed. Axisymmetric model was established for this procedure. The paper presents the results of the investigation of the contact pressure distribution and corresponding reaction of the pavement to various load distribution patterns. The results show differences in some calculated quantities for different load patterns, which need to be verified by the experimental way when also ground response should be observed. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'With the adoption and the ratification of the European Landscape Convention a legally justified need for a clear landscape policy was grounded in the European countries. It includes the elaboration of the new and the improvement of the existing legislative documents on landscape planning, protection and management. The aim of the particular study is to analyse the existing legislative documents in Latvia influencing landscape planning on different scales / and the implementation of the European Landscape Convention. The study emphasizes the complex structure of the Latvian legislative framework affected by the distribution of the normative documents under the various ministries. Therefore, the main problem is unclear responsibility levels and organizational system for solving the issues regarding landscape planning, protection and management. Thus the various discussions between the involved disciplines and responsible institutions are arising. Two groups of the legislative documents influencing the implementation of the landscape policy in Latvia are detected within the study. The first group is strategic documents determining main landscape planning principles and directions at European, national, regional and professional or sectoral level. The second group is operational documents providing a set of actions for the landscape planning, protection and management at the local or the municipality level. The study concludes that operational documents developed by the municipalities are in high importance because of their direct influence on the landscape planning in Latvia. This often leads to the different landscape planning requirements included in the normative documents of the neighbouring municipalities, although the spatial and ecological borders of the visual landscape do not fit with the formal borders of the municipalities. Thus, it is essential to develop the common principles and actions that would be incumbent on all municipalities to provide the landscape integrity and to protect its values according to the main principles defined in the European Landscape Convention. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Information and communication technologies became a part of management tools in modern companies.

They are used for: all types of slope roofs walls of newly-built public and industrial buildings load bearing structures roofs of renovated buildings. The process of assembling buildings from steel frame structures should be analysed as an integrated process influenced by such factors as construction materials and machinery used, the qualification level of construction workers, complexity of work, available finance. It is necessary to find a rational technological design solution for assembling buildings from steel frame structures by conducting a multiple criteria analysis. The analysis provides a possibility to evaluate the engineering considerations and find unequivocal solutions. The rational alternative of a complex process of assembling buildings from steel frame structures was found through multiple criteria analysis and multiple criteria evaluation. In multiple criteria evaluation of technological solutions for assembling buildings from steel frame structures by pairwise comparison method the criteria by significance are distributed as follows: durability is the most important criterion in the evaluation of alternatives the price (EUR/unit of measurement) of a part of assembly process construction workers' qualification level (category) mechanization level of a part of assembling process (%), and complexity of assembling work (in points) are less important criteria. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'Pervious concrete pavement is a recognized sustainable solution for urban roads. To enhance mechanical properties of pervious concrete material, in order to allow wider use of this technology, a lot of studies are going on all over the world. The use of a little percentage of fine aggregates is proven to increase the material resistance without an excessive reduction of permeability. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of replacing the fine virgin aggregates with r cycled tire rubber. 14 different mixes were analysed in terms of indirect tensile strength resistance, void content and density. Two different dimensions of crumb rubber were studied, as well as two different dosages, which were applied to different no-fine control mixes. All results were compared with the same control mixes containing natural fine aggregate. The mixes had a fixed granulometric curve but varied in water/cement ratio this in order to evaluate the effect of recycled rubber depending to w/c ratio of the mix. An image analysis was also conducted to verify the rubber distribution in the mixture and the cracking surfaces. The experimental analysis showed that a correct proportioning of fine sand significantly increased the strength of the material. Moreover, the use of recycled waste tire rubber, gave interesting improvements respect to the no-fine control mixes, even though the developed resistance was lower respect to mixes containing mineral sand. This result was expected because of the cementing property of mineral sand. Although, the important result was that it was possible to use waste tire rubber in pervious concrete, with an appropriate dosage and granular dimension, for increasing the performance of traditional mix design, in order to achieve pavement materials more and more sustainable. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"Against the background of aging and the increasing number of persons in need of care on one hand and the decreasing potential of family support on the other hand, in-patient facilities both in rural areas as well as urban areas of Austria receive importance as final residence.

Regulated rivers have essentially slightly and smoothly curved paths therefore, this methodology provides the appropriate basis for river restoration. Based on the research in the experimental reach of the Holeška Brook and several alluvial mountain streams the methodology was adjusted. The method also takes into account other important characteristics of bottom material - the shape and orientation of the particles, settling velocity and drag coefficients. Thus, the method is mainly meant for the natural sand-gravel material, which is heterogeneous and the particle shape of the bottom material is very different from spherical. The calculation of the river channel in the curved path provides the basis for the design of optimal habitat, but also for the design of foundations of armouring of the bankside of the channel.

In ports, human activities are concentrated in the limited space of the coastal belt, where they threaten the vulnerable equilibrium of the environment. Integrated multifunctional planning of ports is necessary for the sustainability of such plans. In this process, the relation between the environment and the economy is often neglected because the ecosystem - the totality of living organisms - which is fully dependent on biological, chemical, and physical factors, prevails. This method, also called building with nature, is the basis for integrated coastal zone development and management. It emphasizes the flexible integration of land and sea, which respects and uses forces and materials present in nature, and which is an essential interaction between man and environment. Strict ecological planning conditions and the public interest obliged the Port of Koper to modify its urban planning strategies and redefine its relationship with all bordering areas. The extension of two piers and construction of a third one was the result of functional factors, infrastructure connections, technical possibilities, and environmental requirements. Solutions that were relevant for distributing cargo on the docks had to adjust to the width of the basins for manoeuvring ships.

However, issues such as the high upfront costs relating to software and hardware setup and BIM user training, combined with the difficulties of incorporating BIM into existing workflow operations and management systems, remain a challenge to contractors. Consequently, the benefits stemming from the BIM implementation in turn will affect the activeness and enthusiasm of contractors to implement BIM. While there have been previous studies abroad where the benefits relating to BIM implementation had been calculated and quantified numerically, a benefit evaluation index would require considerations for regional industry practices and characteristics. This study established a benefit evaluation index and method for the implementation of BIM suitable for contractors in Taiwan. The three main principal indexes are: (1) RCR means the effects of reducing costs associated with rework (2) SDR & DPR mean the effects of mitigating delays that occur due to construction interface coordination or rework, as well as the effects of reducing the penalty costs associated with overdue delivery (3) AQE means the effects of improving the ability to estimate the amounts of building materials and resources. This study also performed a benefit evaluation calculation of a real world case study construction project using the first two established indexes. The results showed a 0.16% reduction in rework costs, a 6.49% reduction in delays that occur from construction interface coordination or rework, and a 5.0% reduction in penalty costs associated with overdue deliveries.

The most traditional fillers, the Portland cement and the hydrated lime, are well known for resisting to weather variations and adding extra features to the hot mixtures. The glass powder, the cladding waste (gotten from clay bricks), the ashes of rice husks and laterite powder are proposed as substitutes to the traditional ones. The materials have been sieved and classified by fitting the powder on the filler grain size required by Brazilian Rules, eventually they have been tested with asphalt 50/70. The glass powder performed a Thermic Susceptibility Index (IST) of -0.69 for 5% in weight of filler and -0.75 for 10% in weight of filler, proving that this material satisfies the Brazilian specification DNIT-EM 095/2006 on the other hand, the laterite powder presented an IST of -0.61 for 5% and 0.32 for 10%.

Over the lifetime of the water management systems the hydrological time series are never repeated in the same form which served as the input for the design of the system components. The design assumes the observed time series to be representative at the time of the system use. However, it is rather unrealistic assumption, because the hydrological past will not be exactly repeated over the design lifetime. When designing the water management systems, the specialists may occasionally face the insufficient or oversized capacity design, possibly wrong specification of the management rules which may lead to their non-optimal use. It is therefore necessary to establish a comprehensive approach to simulate the fluctuations in the interannual runoff (taking into account the current dry and wet periods) in the form of stochastic modelling techniques in water management practice. The paper deals with the methodological procedure of modelling the mean monthly flows using the stochastic Thomas-Fiering model, while modification of this model by Wilson-Hilferty transformation of independent random number has been applied. This transformation usually applies in the event of significant asymmetry in the observed time series. The methodological procedure was applied on the data acquired at the gauging station of Horné Orešany in the Parná Stream. Observed mean monthly flows for the period of 1.11.1980 - 31.10.2012 served as the model input information. After extrapolation the model parameters and Wilson-Hilferty transformation parameters the synthetic time series of mean monthly flows were simulated. Those have been compared with the observed hydrological time series using basic statistical characteristics (e. g. mean, standard deviation and skewness) for testing the quality of the model simulation. The synthetic hydrological series of monthly flows were created having the same statistical properties as the time series observed in the past. The compiled model was able to take into account the diversity of extreme hydrological situations in a form of synthetic series of mean monthly flows, while the occurrence of a set of flows was confirmed, which could and may occur in the future. The results of stochastic modelling in the form of synthetic time series of mean monthly flows, which takes into account the seasonal fluctuations of runoff within the year, could be applicable in engineering hydrology (e. g. for optimum use of the existing water management system that is related to reassessment of economic risks of the system). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The enhancement of mechanical properties and long term performance of hot mix asphalt (HMA) should be considered as a goal in order to achieve a transport infrastructure really sustainable. However, this issue becomes a difficult task, if conventional HMA are used. In fact, performance of conventional HMA, usually presents poor long term performance and functional distresses related to high and low temperatures, which in turn implies higher maintenance costs and superior carbon footprints. To overcome this weaken, bitumen industry has been developing new polymer modifiers, additives to improve HMA behaviour. One of the techniques most used in developed countries to enhance HMA behaviour is the use of modified bitumen. Modifying the bitumen, and then producing modified HMA requires specific equipment and facilities that may be time-consuming, expensive and hard to manage. For instance, to warranty a successful modifying process, storage and handling of the modified bitumen are issues very complex to handle. On the other hand, producing a polymer modified HMA by adding polymers and additives directly during the bitumen/aggregate mixing process may offer very interesting advantages since the economical, production and sustainability standpoint. This paper aimed to determine the feasibility of the incorporation of fibres and plastomeric polymers into different types of HMA by means of the \"dry process\" (to add polymers during the mixing of aggregate and bitumen in the HMA plant) to produce polymer modified mixes. Thus, laboratory tests including Marshall Stability, Indirect Tensile Stiffness Modulus, repeated load test and Indirect Tensile Strength test were performed to assess the effect of the inclusion of fibres and plastomeric polymers on mechanical and volumetric properties of selected mixes. Results showed that the modification of bituminous mixtures following the \"dry process\" could be used to improve the performance and long term properties of HMA. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Using Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) bars to reinforce two-way concrete slabs can extend the service life, reduce maintenance cost and improve-life cycle cost efficiency. FRP reinforcing bars are more environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional reinforcing steel. Shear behaviour of reinforced concrete structural members is a complex phenomenon that relies on the development of internal load-carrying mechanisms, the magnitude and combination of which is still a subject of research. Many building codes and design standards provide design formulas for estimation of punching shear capacity of FRP reinforced flat slabs. Building code formulas take into account the effects of the axial stiffness of main reinforcement bars, the ratio of the perimeter of the critical section to the slab effective depth, and the slab thickness on the punching shear capacity of two-way slabs reinforced with FRP bars or grids. The goal of this paper is to compare experimental data published in the literature to the equations offered by building codes for the estimation of punching shear capacity of concrete flat slabs reinforced with FRP bars. Emphasis in this paper is on two North American codes, namely, ACI 440.1R-15 and CSA S806-12. The experimental data covered in this paper include flat slabs reinforced with GFRP, BFRP, and CFRP bars. Both ACI 440.1R-15 and CSA S806-12 are shown to be in good agreement with test results in terms of predicting the punching shear capacity. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'This paper introduces a numerical experiment of creating the load bearing system of a high rise building. When designing the high-rise building, it is always an important task to find the right proportion between the height of the building and its perceptive width from the various angles of street view. Investigated high rise building in this article was designed according to these criteria. The load bearing structure of the analysed object consists of a reinforced core, plates and steel tubes of an exoskeleton. Eight models of the building were created using the spatial variant of FEM in Scia Engineer Software. Individual models varied in number and dimensions of diagrids in the exoskeleton. In the models, loadings due to the own weight, weight of external glass cladding, and due to the wind according to the Standard, have been considered. The building was loaded by wind load from all four main directions with respect to its shape. Wind load was calculated using the 3D wind generator, which is a part of the Scia Engineer Software. For each model the static analysis was performed. Its most important criterion was the maximum or minimum horizontal displacement (rotation) of the highest point of the building. This displacement was compared with the limit values of the displacement of the analysed high-rise building. By step-by-step adding diagrids and optimizing their dimensions the building model was obtained that complied with the criteria of the Limit Serviceability State. The last model building was assessed also for the Ultimate Limit State.

We can find such a structures as part of roofs or design facades. By using these lamellas like, non-bearing structures as a part of architectural design of buildings, it is necessary to consider wind effects on these structures. Subtle structures of this type are prone to vibration in the transverse direction of the wind flow. The fact that the vibration occurs depends on wind parameters (wind velocity, direction of an air flow) and it also depends on the properties of lamella (shape, length, mass, natural frequency, support type). The principal idea of this article is to show susceptibility of lamellae-like structures to transverse resonant vibration caused by the phenomenon called Von Karman effect. Comparison of susceptibility to transverse resonance vibration was analysed on the different shapes of lamellas loaded by different wind speed. Analysis was based on usage of empirically derived equations. Von Karman effect arise from wind flow past an object. Turbulence in the form of vortices are formed at the object and shed into the flowing stream intermittently. The potential problem is that this turbulence can induce vibrations into the lamella itself. In terms of this vibration problem, two frequencies are interesting. Von Karman shedding frequency is the frequency at which the vortices are formed and shed at the object. The vortex-shedding frequency increases with the velocity of the wind flow and decreases with the size of the object. Natural frequency of the object depends on the construction of the lamella itself. Parameters of lamella as a shape, mass, length, elasticity modulus of material and support types are directly involved in the calculation of natural frequency. Worst case scenario in the term of transverse resonant vibration occurs when the natural frequency of lamella is equal to the vortex-shedding frequency. In this case vibration rises and structure can be snapped or deformed permanently. In the long term vibration, fatigue stress can be significant. At the conclusion hazardous wind speed and recommendations for different shapes and parameters of lamellas are shown. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"Ecological footprint determines how much natural resources are consumed by an individual, city, region, state or all inhabitants of our planet in order to ensure their requirements and needs.

The team of researchers from the Faculty of Architecture SUT Bratislava introduces possibilities of using lightweight roofs on the model example of a dominant medieval ruin (Romanesque Palace, Spiš Castle, UNESCO site). Architectural 3D-modelling of alternatives gains new methodical importance in conditions, when in real practice only safeguarding conservation approaches are preferred. Research based on design serves as a tool for decision-making on further restoration approaches to a specific cultural heritage object. The selected Romanesque Palace of the Spiš Castle has passed through many structural periods. The interior doesn't exist and the perimeter walls create a raised landscape landmark. Romanesque, gothic and renaissance periods were identifiable. It would be possible to reconstruct these periods partially hypothetically on the basis of saved archive materials. Inner structures and the roofing of the palace were in individual historical periods changed. Exact frame models of a new roofing were created on the principle of hypothetical reconstruction: from the indication of the medieval form, renaissance form until contemporary new forms respecting the present day horizontal palace's topping. The aim of the first stage of the research was to present a few architectural alternatives of the roof structure refilling according to the given cultural heritage determinants and structural possibilities. We introduce 12 solutions in graphic and text, which present architectural models of a new roofing, covering the interior by transparent structure based on glass panels and translucent structures based on a textile membrane. We achieve a new space for new functional use of the palace by means of various ways of physical enclosing. On the other side, we work with alternatives of the perimeter wall perforation according to the historical periods. New inserted structures are designed in contemporary technologies and materials. An analysis of particular architectural proposals is the result. The shape, material selection (steel, timber), roof support structure selection and choice of transparent or translucent covering are subordinated to the architectural concept of the historical period's presentation including contemporaneousness. The solved problem was, how new interventions are able to visually coexist with historical original without diminishing its authenticity. Glazed and membrane structures used for covering authentic ruins request professional architectural modelling of alternatives based on exact historical facts. The decision making process is made easier by visualizations. Structural shapes issued from original tectonic rules (standard, order) appear from the point of visual and also monument restoration criteria more favourable than structural shapes, which were not inspired by these rules. Plane shaped glazed roof shapes from this point of view seem to be more intrinsic than rounded. On the other side, alternatives with use of textile membranes have soft shape morphology, which is beneficial for new and also historic shapes of roofing in this researched example. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'A seawall, also known as a bulkhead or retaining wall, is a structure built to reduce the effects of strong waves and to defend costal land from erosion. Traditionally, seawalls are made of steel, timber or concrete construction. Composite materials, however, have been recently introduced for their ease of installation/maintenance in dry processing, low cost, and environmentally friendly materials. A wood plastic composite (WPC) seawall system has been developed and patented for its unique hollow structure that can give greater stiffness and stability under various external stresses. This paper describes the development of design method used in the analysis of the WPC walls. The main challenge during the physical excavation works is to limit the deformations involved in order to minimize damage on adjacent structures. The deformations depend largely on the excavation and strutting procedures, but also on the properties of the structural elements like the soil, the sheet pile and strutting members. The detailed design procedure involves numerical analyses, national regulations and common practice considerations. The contribution of finite element method in this field was used herein to determine the lateral movements, the bending moments of the wall, the passive earth pressure of the soil and the tensile force exerted by the anchor rods. The overall objectives of this research can be divided into two categories, First calibration of the finite element model for the new Tur quay walls (the case study) and reviewing the results of the steel cross section that chosen and the suggested one.

Currently, there are several methods of particle dimension measurement available that are based on different physical principles. Pipette method based on the different sedimentation velocity of particles with different diameter is considered to be one of the standard methods of individual grain size fraction distribution determination. Following the technical advancement, optical methods such as laser diffraction can be also used nowadays for grain size distribution determination in the soil. According to the literature review of domestic as well as international sources related to this topic, it is obvious that the results obtained by laser diffractometry do not correspond with the results obtained by pipette method. The main aim of this paper was to analyse 132 samples of medium fine soil, taken from the Nitra River catchment in Slovakia, from depths of 15-20 cm and 40-45 cm, respectively, using laser analysers: ANALYSETTE 22 MicroTec plus (Fritsch GmbH) and Mastersizer 2000 (Malvern Instruments Ltd). The results obtained by laser diffractometry were compared with pipette method and the regression relationships using linear, exponential, power and polynomial trend were derived. Regressions with the three highest regression coefficients (R2) were further investigated. The fit with the highest tightness was observed for the polynomial regression. In view of the results obtained, we recommend using the estimate of the representation of the clay fraction (<0.01 mm) polynomial regression, to achieve a highest confidence value R2 at the depths of 15-20 cm 0.72 (Analysette 22 MicroTec plus) and 0.95 (Mastersizer 2000), from a depth of 40-45 cm 0.90 (Analysette 22 MicroTec plus) and 0.96 (Mastersizer 2000). Since the percentage representation of clayey particles (2nd fraction according to the methodology of Complex Soil Survey done in Slovakia) in soil is the determinant for soil type specification, we recommend using the derived relationships in soil science when the soil texture analysis is done according to laser diffractometry. The advantages of laser diffraction method comprise the short analysis time, usage of small sample amount, application for the various grain size fraction and soil type classification systems, and a wide range of determined fractions. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on this issue further to address the needs of soil science research and attempt to replace the standard pipette method with more progressive laser diffraction method. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"This article proposes to make a comparative bioclimatic analysis from 1990 to 2014 of the main square of Antofagasta, a coastal desert city in Chile, which was remodelled in 1995, and shows how the redesigning of green areas affects the microclimatic conditions and thermal comfort of the urban space. Ex ante measurements dating 1990 were compared with ex post results from 2014. Data were obtained in both cases in the month of September at different times of a day and in different climate conditions. The variables studied were: land surface temperature, humidity, wind speed, amount of light and square use frequency inside the square and in surrounding streets. The temperatures are not statistically different during the years 1990 and 2014 for the city of Antofagasta. The main layout of the square has not changed, and inside the square it is similar for both periods, but new species were introduced and bigger trees with shadow projection were cut down. The square had a micro-climate role in 2014 as well as in 1990. The highest frequency zone with an important surface lost it is comfort thermic condition with an increase of 1°C. Other smaller zones with less relevance for users gained in cooling with a 0.5°C reduction. The new design has been detrimental to the intensity of its micro climatic regulatory function affecting the thermic comfort of the square's internal spaces, especially those formerly protected by shadow, which mitigate a high solar radiation. The study results suggest that bio-climatic analysis of public open spaces is a key component for the design of future projects as a heat mitigating tool in the context of climate change. Research question is: How does the redesign of the square impact a cool urban island and the thermic comfort of users? Significant differences between data in situ collected in 1990 and 2014. Thermal comfort was negatively affected by the redesign in the square. The square is still a cool island but with less strength. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'Groundwater resources of mineral and thermo-mineral water are invaluable for planning a sustainable spatial and economic development of the Rogaška Slatina area, which requires a protection of this natural heritage. Numerous previous investigations of Rogaška groundwaters were subjects to balneology and to demands for larger exploitation quantities, that is why information are missing that are essential for definition of the Rogaška fractured aquifer system with mineral and thermo-mineral water and for its protection. The isotopic investigations of groundwaters stored in the Rogaška Slatina fractured aquifer system were performed aiming at answering open questions on the groundwater recharge and dynamics, on connections between different types of aquifers and on solute transport. Environmental isotopes 2H, 18O, 3H, 13C of dissolved inorganic carbon and 14C were analysed in mineral, thermo-mineral and spring waters. Results indicated the source and mechanism of groundwater recharge, its renewability, a transit time distribution, hydraulic interrelationships, the groundwater origin and its evolution due to effects of water-rock interaction. The mean residence time estimates of mineral and thermo- mineral water in the aquifer are between 3400 and 14000 years. On the other hand, the mixing processes between younger and older waters or mineral and spring waters are reflected as well as waters that infiltrated predominantly after the 1960s. These suggest the vulnerability of the research systems to man-made impacts. The presented results coupled with available information on a physical hydrogeology and water chemistry asses the optimal balance between the environmental protection and economic use of mineral water resources in the study area. They are essential for the protection strategy development of mineral and thermo-mineral water in the Rogaška Slatina area bringing together the state administration and local authorities and stakeholders. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"Land use relates to the exploitation of land through human activity in the landscape. Land use is also one of the best indicators of a landscape's structure and processes. Land cover comprises manmade surfaces, agricultural areas, forest and semi-natural areas, wetlands, and bodies of water. In Slovenia more than half of the land (63%) is forested. Manmade surfaces represent less than 5%. A large proportion of relatively inaccessible forest is the main reason why society had a less critical impact on forests in the past in Slovenia in comparison to the majority of central European countries. Regarding the high-quality landscape in the country, Slovenia's natural features are characterized by a mix of forest and farmland. These land categories (i.e., complex cultivation patterns and land principally used for agriculture with significant areas of natural vegetation) cover 23% of Slovenia. Land-use data for farmland are gathered and provided to the relevant institutions by landowners, who are not specialists in land-use data. In addition, land use is only a two-dimensional tool, which does not recognize elevation differences and terraced slopes. Terraced areas are either omitted from the inventory of land-use data because landowners do not report them, or they are included in the inventory because landowners do not realize that their land is not terraced. Consequently, the differences between the official data on vineyards, orchards, and olive groves on terraces and actual terraced slopes with such land use may differ significantly. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'The Palace of the Counts of Padul is the most emblematic building of Padul, Province of Granada in Spain, being one of the most remarkable buildings of the region of the Valley of Lecrín. It is a building of undoubted historical value. It is classified as one of Cultural Interest, which means maximum level of protection of the Spanish legislation in historical heritage. In spite of being a historical symbol of Padul, most of the citizens ignore its importance. It was built in the first part of the XVII century. D. Antonio de Aróstegui y Zazo (knight of the Santiago order and a secretary of Felipe III) was its developer. He gave the building a noble character with an unusual design for this shire. The ground floor has an L shape. Besides, it has two floors and two squared towers, and standing out there is a third floor covered by a pitched roof. Also, it has load-bearing walls of masonry. Only the corners are built with carved stones. Deck is built with logs, and bricks, and wooden roof trusses. It looks like a solid simple house of civil architecture at the beginning of the Baroque style. Analyzing the urban morphology of Padul, the uniqueness of the plot is important related to the urban fabric. It is also remarkable its strategic position with respect to the historical roads that crossed there: The royal road that came from Granada heading to the Alpujarras, and leading to Motril and the road that starting in Malaga crossed through Alhama and arrived in Padul. It is clear the function of controlling the necessary passage towards the Lecrin Valley, the Alpujarras and the Mediterranean coast. Immediately after its declaration in 1981 as a National Monument, and despite this, it suffered an unfortunate intervention which has been maintained until today. The council of Padul would like to acquire it presenting a project for its recovery. This situation provoked the invitation of the council to the University of Granada to help with that. And this would allow the students of Final Project Degree of the Higher Technical School of Building Engineering to have it as a real object to work. By focusing our attention on this building, it is intended to preserve its valuable heritage, showing its history, proposing technical solutions for preservation, and finally, to make the Casa Grande popular for the residents of Padul and all visitors. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"The main purpose of this work is to study the advantages offered by the application of traditional techniques of technical drawing in processes for automation of the design, with non-parametric CAD programs, provided with scripting languages. Given that an example drawing can be solved with traditional step-by-step detailed procedures, is possible to do the same with CAD applications and to generalize it later, incorporating references. In today's modern CAD applications, there are striking absences of solutions for building engineering: oblique projections (military and cavalier), 3D modelling of complex stairs, roofs, furniture, and so on. The use of geometric references (using variables in script languages) and their incorporation into high-level CAD templates allows the automation of processes. Instead of repeatedly creating similar designs or modifying their data, users should be able to use these templates to generate future variations of the same design. This paper presents the automation process of several complex drawing examples based on CAD script files aided with parametric geometry calculation tools. The proposed method allows us to solve complex geometry designs not currently incorporated in the current CAD applications and to subsequently create other new derivatives without user intervention. Automation in the generation of complex designs not only saves time but also increases the quality of the presentations and reduces the possibility of human errors. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'Urban system is a complex mix of interdependent components and dynamic interactions between them that enable it to function effectively. Resilience of urban system indicates the ability of a system to resist, absorb, accommodate to and recover from the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient manner. In the relevant literature, most studies consider individual components separately. On the other hand, the purpose of this paper is to assess the urban system as a whole, considering all relevant components and their interactions. The goal is a study of possibilities for holistic evaluation of urban system resilience to natural disasters. Findings from the preliminary study are presented: (i) the definition of urban system and categorization of its components, (ii) a set of attributes of individual components with impact on disaster resilience of the entire system and (iii) review of different methods and approaches for resilience assessment. Based on literature review and extensive preliminary studies a new conceptual framework for urban resilience assessment is proposed. In the presented paper, a conceptual model of urban system by abstraction of its components as nodes (buildings), patches - specific nodes with spatial properties (open space), links (infrastructures) and base layer (community) is created. In the suggested model, each component is defined by its own quantitative attributes, which have been identified to have an important impact on the urban system resilience to natural disasters. System is presented as a mathematical graph model. Natural disaster is considered an external factor that affects the existing system and leads to some system distortion. In further analyses, mathematical simulation of various natural disasters scenarios is going to be carried out, followed by comparison of the system functionality before and after the accident. Various properties of the system (accessibility, transition, complexity etc.) are going to be analysed with graph theory. The final result is going to be an identification of critical points and system bottlenecks as basis for further actions of risk mitigation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The recent advances in the wood construction field have demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of using wood-based materials in tall buildings structures and other constructive uses, which could lead to a net reduction in CO2eq emissions of the construction sector by replacing high-energy consuming materials like concrete or steel, with wood and biomass-based materials. Among these biomass-based materials are the Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFP)which are plantsthat canprovide important contributionsto the construction sector and help to reduce the net CO2eq emissions of the building industry. One of these plants is the totora (Schoenoplectus Californicus) that has been long used by several communities for making handicrafts and as construction material. Recent studies on this plant have analyzed its properties and its feasibility to be used for producing materials of interest to the contemporary building industry. The totora is a bulrush that grows in lakes and marshes in America from California to Chile and some of the Pacific islands. It grows from the sea level to 4500maasl, it can grow in fresh water and estuaries, and it is resistant to water level changes and drought. This bulrush has been used by many cultures as medicine, food, forage, material for building houses, boats and different handicrafts. The most important examples of the use of totora in the world are the floating islands of the Uros in Lake Titicaca. The Uros people have developed traditional techniques for building their homes, boats, and even the artificial islands where they live on with methods based almost exclusively on the totora. This way of living and production system has been maintained for more than 500 years. This review is about the main constructive techniques that have been used for traditional construction in totora and some of therecent researches that have been made on this subject. Experiments in architecture and industrial design objects made with totora have shown its versatility, durability and high aesthetic value which is exploited in object design and architectural finishes. Additionally, recent studies on the insulating capacity of totora samples have determined an average conductivity of 0,06W/mK, which is comparable to some of the common insulating materials in the current market. The review of the historical uses and recent studies on this material indicate its potential in the contemporary construction field along with other environmental benefits. One of the key features is the totora productivity that can be as much as 56 tons of dry matter per hectare per year, which is near 5 times the average production of a conifer plantation. Therefore, to foster the research about its feasible applications in the contemporary construction field could lead to the reduction of the pressure on wood forests and plantations by developing a new material source for the construction industry. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The aqueduct of the Caños de Carmona was in operation from 1172 until its demolition in 1912.Its infrastructure was an essential resource to supply water to the city of Seville.

Its significance lies not only in the fact that they are the most significant operations of architecture of the modern movement in their respective cities, but are especially noteworthy the values derived from its strategic location within the urban structure of these intermediate scale cities. Being near to city centre, they have been constituted as transition pieces between historic sites, new peripheral developments, and even, their nearest territory. As method, this research proposes a comparative analysis of traceability among different study cases, from medium-sized cities of the Andalusian Coast (Spain). In this context, it means recording the evolution that these promotions have been experienced since their first designs until their current situation. It attempts to find the characteristics that have resulted in the urban configuration of this periphery and to recognize the sum of all the cultural, economic, social and technological aspects that conditions the ways of life that today are detected in them.

Technical seismicity means seismic shakes caused by force impulse, random process and unnatural origin. The vibration influence on buildings is evaluated in the Eurocode 8 in Slovak Republic, however, the Slovak Technical Standard STN 73 0036 includes solution of the technical seismicity. This standard also classes bridges into the group of structures that are significant in light of the technical seismicity - the group \"U\". Using the case studies analysis by FEM simulation and comparison is necessary because of brief norm evaluation of this issue. In this article, determinate dynamic parameters by experimental measuring and numerical method on two real bridges are compared. First bridge, (D201 - 00) is Scaffold Bridge on the road I/11 leading to the city of Čadca and is situated in the city of Žilina. It is eleven - span concrete road bridge. The railway is the obstacle, which this bridge spans. Second bridge (M5973 Brodno) is situated in the part of Žilina City on the road of I/11. It is concrete three - span road bridge built as box girder. The computing part includes 3D computational models of the bridges. First bridge (D201 - 00) was modelled in the software of IDA Nexis as the slab - wall model. The model outputs are natural frequencies and natural vibration modes. Second bridge (M5973 Brodno) was modelled in the software of VisualFEA. The technical seismicity corresponds with the force impulse, which was put into this model. The model outputs are vibration displacements, velocities and accelerations. The aim of the experiments was measuring of the vibration acceleration time record of bridges, and there was need to systematic placement of accelerometers. The vibration acceleration time record is important during the under - bridge train crossing, about the first bridge (D201 - 00) and the vibration acceleration time domain is important during deducing the force impulse under the bridge, about second bridge (M5973 Brodno). The analysis was done in the software of Sigview. About the first bridge (D201 - 00), the analysis output were values of power spectral density adherent to the frequencies values. These frequencies were compared with the natural frequencies values from the computational model whereby the technical seismicity influence on bridge natural frequencies was found out. About the second bridge (M5973 Brodno), the Sigview display of recorded vibration velocity time history was compared with the final vibration velocity time history from the computational model, whereby the results were incidental. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The Arab Spring transformations have caused tangible impacts on the urban environment throughout the Middle East with varying levels. In some cities in countries like Libya, Yemen and Syria, deliberate and accidental destruction has taken place, resulting in severe transformations in the image of these cities that could be considered as lasting or difficult to amend. In some cities, the damage caused to urban built environment could be considered a co-lateral damage as a result of internal fighting between the people and their regimes, or the fighting between the different factions in the country or from external interference of regional or international powers. Urbicide, which is defined as a deliberate destruction of cities is also another form of damaging the built environment or the city image, in which parties in an internal conflict tend to destroy symbols or quarters of their rivals to inflict a tangible damage to their social and moral believes. The impacts on the built environment and the image of the city, can result as well from non-destructive measures, for example changes in land uses or decisions to demolish specific buildings that belong to the former era will also result in a clear change in the city image. This paper highlights the types of transformation of the city images that took place as a result of the Arab Spring revolutions. The cases discussed in this paper focus mainly on cities from both Syria and Egypt. This highlighting is done in regard to the nature of change, as mentioned above, the violent transformation in the case of Syrian cities and few cases in Egypt and the nonviolent transformation with the examples from Egypt. In case of the Syrian cities the transformation is caused and sparked by the civil conflict, however the course of reconstruction of these cities after the conflict ends is argued to take one of three paths reconstruction, renovation or redevelopment. While in case of the nonviolent transformation that is taking place already in Egypt, the nature of change was affected by political, social and security aspects, which in turn had direct impacts on the images of the Egyptian cities after the Arab Spring revolutions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) bars are gaining popularity as sustainable alternatives to conventional reinforcing steel bars in reinforced concrete applications. The production of FRP bars has lower environmental impact compared to steel reinforcing bars. In addition, the non-corroding FRP materials can potentially decrease the cost or need for maintenance of reinforced concrete structural elements, especially in harsh environmental conditions that can impact both concrete and reinforcement. FRP bars offer additional favourable properties including high tensile strength and low unit weight. However, the mechanical properties of FRP bars can lead to large crack widths and deflections. The objective of this study is to investigate the deflection behaviour of concrete beams reinforced with Glass FRP (GFRP) bars as a longitudinal main reinforcement. Six concrete beams reinforced with GFRP bars were modelled using the finite element computer program ANSYS. The main variable considered in the study is the reinforcement ratio. The deflection equations in current North American codes including ACI 440.1R-06, ACI 440.1R-15 and CSA S806-12 are used to compute deflections, and these are compared to numerical results. It was concluded in this paper that deflections predicted by ACI 440.1R-06 equations are lower than the numerical analysis results while ACI 440.1R-15 is in agreement with numerical analysis with tendency to be conservative. The values of deflections estimated by CSA S806-12 formulas are consistent with results of numerical analysis. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The approach to the calculation of the structure of a building, apart from the geometry and its peculiarities always in the first instance, the first approach is to analyze the state of loads, according to current legislation CTE, to which the building will be subjected and In their respective plants and areas, these loads are defined in any of the regulations in force at the moment in Spain and almost all the professionals of the sector known for their application.

A urban continuum peculiar to the region, than may be better understood as an area of shared territorially with several elements in common and as a community where individual interests intersect with common interests. The importance of the geographical location of this region is more than notable. It is on the Bay of Biscay right where Spain curves northward to meet France it is the only natural point of passage on the west end of the Pyrenees Mountains, with La Junquera in Catalonia at the east end, thus communicating the Iberian Peninsula with the rest of Europe. This is the strategic point for each and every known means of transport. The rail system consists of three different types of track gauge the road network includes major motorways and the national road system the airports at Hondarribia and Biarritz and the natural port of Pasaia complements this transportation node. All of this takes place in a small space, a natural corridor at the foot of Mount Jaizkibel. What was once considered modern infrastructures sufficient to meet transportation needs is today absolutely insufficient, obsolete and in operative. A set of partial solutions lacking an overall vision cannot be considered an integrated system. Therein lies the origin of the problem. Here is the diagnosis: The Port of Pasaia is obsolete. Pressure is felt from urban growth in the surrounding cities and from the restrictions of the Hondarribia airport. The roads are completely saturated and traffic continues to increase. The railway service is inefficient owing to three different types of track gauge. And each of these infrastructures is subject to its own restrictions and management. This forces us to think about the current state of these services and to come up with a new way of organizing this \"infrastructures complex\" that can efficiently solve the problems of mobility, based on the different services complementing each other. The system must be understood as a \"whole\", a system made up of individual parts which are effective in their relationship with the rest of the parts, a single way of understanding and dealing with the problem.

The Cistercian Order played a remarkable role in the affirmation of Portugal (1143) and had unquestionable position, since the medieval period, in the construction of a significant part of the Portuguese culture. The reform of many Monasteries came with the Autonomous Congregation of Alcobaça (1567). In fact, the Portuguese Cistercian Monasteries absorbed the regional ways of construction with masonry (granite in the north and limestone in the south) but it is without a doubt in its architecture that change and renewal can be found as strength and a tool for achieving a status of cultural landmarks. The renewal and reform in the Portuguese Cistercian Monasteries was not restricted to the styles in vogue but also was related to the physical expansion of the monasteries. This could be achieved by adding new aisles and cloisters like in Alcobaça or Salzedas Monasteries. Though there are cases of unconventional renewals and reformations such as the existence of two churches in the Monastery of Salzedas and the example of the open air Museum of the Monastery of S.

One of the possibilities of reconciling this contradiction is using pseudo windows that are visible on the elevation and generally have the form of a black painted recess accompanied by frames and sashes and often single glazing. Of course, there are no windows or openings in the corresponding places in the walls inside the building. The article discusses the differences between false windows and blind widows (German: blende), also known as blank windows, which, in fact, are shallow recesses in the wall having the external appearance of an arcade or a window and which had already been used in Gothic architecture mostly for aesthetic reasons and sometimes to reduce the load of the wall. Moreover, the article describes various false windows that appeared later than blind windows because they did not appear until the 17th century. Contemporary false windows are also discussed and it is shown that contrary to the common belief they are widely used. In his research, the author not only used the Internet data but also carried out his own in situ exploration. The false windows constitute very interesting albeit rare elements of the architectural design of buildings. They have been used successfully for a few hundred years. It might seem that they should have been discarded by now but this has not happened. Quite contrary, since the second half of the 20th century there has been a rapid development of glass curtain walls that serve a similar function in contemporary buildings as the false windows once did, only in a more extensive way. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Nowadays, one of the main issues that the cities are facing is related with how they are dealing with the challenges toward smartness, including infrastructures, economic, social and environmental aspects. In this sense, some of the current challenges on the global scale, trying to find solutions regarding urban societies, are based on the concept of \"smart city\". Therefore, is clear that new ideas regarding the cities improvements, which are on the top of global agenda, could be found at the concept of \"smart city\". As the literature reveals, this is a topic reason among the researchers, which is in a continuous development, in particular regarding societies, countries or regions where it is emerging, such as in the Arabian territories. Dubai, a city in the United Arab Emirates, is an example where in a short period of time, after the oil discovery in the decade of 1970, one small and badly known urban settlement became a pioneer reference in terms of smart cities requirements. Thus, this article presents background information about smart cities, their assets and key pillars, their smart infrastructures and features in cultural, social and environmental terms. The main goals are based on a theoretical approach, developed in order to get more details about smart cities, regarding the features of the Arabian territories. It argues around the case of Dubai, as a pioneer smart city in the Arab world. Among of the main conclusions, there is the idea that the urban transformation process in contemporary societies to secure the smartness, should apply to the use of ICT / information and communication technologies. This use will increase the efficiency concerns to the natural resources, and provide a high quality of life for citizens. The example of Dubai has shown that the decision-makers have built each sector and part of the city in a solid performance, in order to achieve the smart sustainability concept.

Among the factors influencing the intersection delay, variable of saturation degree (Xc) is one of the most important variables. In the present study, a new analytical method has been proposed for calculating delay variation at isolated intersections in under-saturated condition and under the influence of different number of vehicles entering to the intersections. Generally, the average delay for average number of vehicles entering intersection is currently calculated by the point to point method then, the level of service of intersection is specified from the resulting delay. In the meantime, the influence of different number of vehicles entering to the intersections cannot be seen in such methods. But for the presented method in this paper the delay is expressed as a range of values for different values of saturation degree and different numbers of vehicles entering the intersections that it leads to achieve more real results from intersection's level of service. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'A vertical slum is defined as a socially vulnerable community in a building, with serious problems of functionality, safety and habitability. It is related to an important level of physical degradation, and a precarious socioeconomic situation of its occupants. Their inability to create a real community for proper and mandatory maintenance increases the physical deterioration of the building. The abandonment of the original owners of the houses can cause a system of illegal occupation and illegal activities, and vice versa. In many cases, the new occupants are primarily interested in maintaining the building in a state of precariousness in order to avoid any attempt of renovation by administrations. These security and habitability problems often extend outside the building and they affect a whole community of neighbours within the neighbourhood who feel threatened and insecure, causing their rejection and a strong social segregation in the area. This article wants to show some of the results from a research work developed on a case study of vertical slum in the city of Malaga, in Spain. In this context of marginality previously described, the research project explores different alternatives for the renovation of a building, its vulnerable community and the neighbourhood in which it is inserted. The project establishes four major objectives: (a) a physical renovation of the building, (b) social transformation in a disadvantaged environment, (c) functional evolution-from a residential model to a new hybrid model with a mixed supply of social services, and (d) the incorporation of new parameters of environmental sustainability that improve the energetic behaviour of the building (transforming it into a building of almost zero consumption). The research closes with a series of strategies and results for the case study. However, the main contribution of the work is related to the research methodology that has been developed. This is structured according to the four principles of integrated urban renovation, based on a physical, social, economic and environmental perspective. This methodology and results have been explained so that they can be transferred to other areas and experience of urban recycling in vulnerable social environments. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The medina of Tetuan has suffered a steady growing since its founding at the end of xv century by Sidi al-Mandary. It has always followed the Islamic city rules and included those works carried away by the sultan. This process had two breaking moments, that of the occupation of the city by the Spanish army in 1860 and the establishment of the Spanish protectorate. The first inside widening of the Luneta Street of the medina took place when the Rif War had already finished (provoked by the establishment of the Spanish Protectorate). The Widening was being built and the \"modernity\" could astonish anyone. The motives for Hadj Ahmed El Oddi to build his own house in the heart of the medina should be searched in the \"kaida\", that is the tradition so close to the muslin character of Tetuan. Building inside the medina meant not only keeping the familiar tradition but following the way of life their family, neighbours, friends kept. It was considered improper to do it in a different place. They could own properties in the new quarters, but only to be rented, not to be first residence. Dar Oddi was built in 1920 in the city centre al-Blal, the oldest quarter of the medina of Tetuan. Built on the foundation of a demolished house would be built as the new houses already built inside the medina by neighbours and relatives. That \\'current fashion\\' was similar to a muslin house of the beginning of the XX century: based on the tradition but contaminated by the social changes taking place outside he medina and in short inside. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The article aims to determine how effective the stricter current requirements for the building envelope insolation are from the economic energy savings perspective. The article deals with a mathematical method for economic assessment of optimal building thermal insulation. The mathematical methods used in this article are based on evaluating the break-even point between the construction expenditures and the economic profit. Recent research shows that energy savings achieved solely through stricter standards applied to the building envelopes are limited in their ability to achieve maximum results. As the ratio of building volume to building envelope increases, further energy saving measures applied to the building envelope produce lower energy saving effects. Energy savings achieved using renewable energy resources, recuperation systems are much more effective. Research shows that much greater effect can be achieved by combining optimal building envelope energy efficiency measures with new requirements related to renewable energy sources and recuperating systems, such as solar batteries, wind turbines or heat pumps. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Among other pieces of architectural historical heritage in Sarajevo, and Bosnia-Herzegovina in general, the Austro-Hungarian architecture has preserved its original architectural, artistic and engineering characteristics. Both residential and public representative urban blocks, streets and squares are of distinguishable ambience in the architectural and urban image of the city and are testifying about our architectural past. A number of buildings is valorised and protected by law in terms of their architectural, artistic and historical value. In addition, these buildings have a distinct functional, ambiental, historical, and even aesthetical value. To make them last longer, refurbishment of these buildings is challenging and presents potential and multiple benefits for the city, and beyond. Refurbishing built environment through functional reorganizing, redesign and energy efficiency measures applications could result in prolonged longevity, architectural identity preservation and interior comfort improvement. Besides, implemented measures for energy efficiency, through the refurbishment process, should optimize the needs for energy consumption in treated buildings. This paper defines options in comfort improvements and redesign, without implying risks to the building longevity, analyses interventions and energy efficiency measures which would enable potential energy saving assessment in the refurbishment process of masonry buildings. This paper also discusses the different techniques that can be adopted for conservation and preservation of historical masonry buildings from the Austro-Hungarian period dealing with energy efficiency. The works were preceded by historical research and on-site investigations. This paper describes a methodology to quantify their vulnerability. A scheme of structural retrofitting is suggested following the research conducted. Revitalization of the building consisted in the reconstruction of the old building structure, creating the inner courtyard and covering it with a glass roof. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"Real time passenger information system is one of the key element of promoting public transport. For the successful implementation of real time passenger information systems, various components should be considered, such as: passenger needs and requirements, stakeholder involvement, technological solution for tracking, data transfer, etc. This article carrying out designing and evaluation of real time passenger information (RTPI) in the city of Maribor. The design phase included development of methodology for selection of appropriate macro and micro location of the real-time panel, development of a real-time passenger algorithm, definition of a technical specification, financial issues and time frame. The evaluation shows that different people have different requirements therefore, the system should be adaptable to be used by various types of people, according to the age, the purpose of journey, experience of using public transport, etc. The average difference between perceived waiting time for a bus is 35% higher than the actual waiting time and grow with the headway increase. Experiences from Maribor have shown that the reliability of real time passenger system (from technical point of view) must be close to 100%, otherwise the system may have negative impact on passengers and may discourage the use of public transport. Among considered events of arrivals during the test period, 92% of all prediction were accurate. The cost benefit analysis has focused only on potential benefits from reduced perceived users waiting time and foreseen costs of real time information system in Maribor for 10 years' period. Analysis shows that the optimal number for implementing real time passenger information system at the bus stops in Maribor is set on 83 bus stops (approx. 20 %) with the highest number of passenger. If we consider all entries at the chosen bus stops, the total perceived waiting time on yearly level could be decreased by about 60,000 hours. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'The intention of this work is to highlight the importance of understanding military cemeteries as objects of cultural and historical heritage and as a part of garden design history. The design and maintenance of cemeteries and graves is a manifestation of the national culture. This is even more evident in military cemeteries, the maintenance of which is regulated by international agreements. Objects of military cemeteries are important places not only from the historical and architectural point of view, but also as green space. Most military cemeteries in Slovakia originated from World War I and II. In Slovakia, 160,000 soldiers were buried, 75,206 of them lost their lives in World War I and 93,000 in World War II. 32,495 war graves are registered by The Ministry of the Interior of the Slovak Republic-23,316 war graves from World War I and 9,179 from World War II. From the period of World War II, there are 22 cemeteries and graveyards in Slovakia, established for soldiers of the Soviet, German, Romanian and Czechoslovak army. Military cemeteries and memorials are mostly high quality works of architecture and art. This paper focuses on the current situation and restoration issues of military cemeteries by examining the Military Cemetery in Zvolen. In the context of its planned reconstruction, a comprehensive tree assessment has been started in 2016. The Military Cemetery in Zvolen, being one of the largest military cemeteries in Slovakia, consists of The Cemetery of the Soviet Army with 17,628 buried soldiers and The Romanian Cemetery with 11,000 buried soldiers. The Romanian Cemetery is one of the largest cemeteries of the Romanian Army in Europe. Both cemeteries were declared national cultural monuments in 1963. In the cemetery, dendrometrical parameters and the health condition of trees were evaluated. In total, there are 825 woody plants. In both cemeteries, coniferous trees prevail, mainly individuals of the genus Thuja (49.4 %). Moreover, the maintenance of greenery and the aesthetics of the landscape composition were assessed. Based on the assessment of woody plant species composition, health condition of trees and their aesthetic qualities, necessary changes in the cemetery landscape composition were designed. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"Saturation flow rate is one of the important items in the analysis of the capacity of signalized intersections that are affected by some factors. Pedestrian crossing on signalized intersection is one of the factors which influence the vehicles flow. In addition, the released researches determined that the greatest impact of pedestrian on the saturation flow occurred in the Conflict zone where the highest chance of the encounter of pedestrians and vehicles has in turning movements. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the saturation flow rate considering the effect of a pedestrian on right turn movements of the signalized intersections in Rasht city. For this goal, 6 signalized intersections with 90 cycles of reviews were selected for the estimation of saturation flow rate by the microscopic method and also 3 right turn lanes containing radius differences with 70 cycles of reviews were collected for the investigation of the pedestrians' effects. Each phase of right turn lanes cycle was divided in the pieces of 10-second period which was totally 476 sample volumes of considered pedestrians and vehicles at that period. Only 101 samples of those were ranged as saturated conditions. Finally, using different regression models, the best relationship between pedestrian's volume and right turning vehicles flow parameters was evaluated. The results indicate that there is a primarily linear relationship between pedestrian volume and right turning vehicles flow with R2=0.6261. According to this regression model with the increase in pedestrians, saturation flow rate will be reduced. In addition, by comparing the adjustment factor obtained in the present study and other studies, it was found that the effect of pedestrians on the right-turn movements in Rasht city is less than the rest of the world. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'In a context of a shifting environmental, economic and social paradigm, European cities face a situation that is at the same time challenge and opportunity: the need for urban rehabilitation of the vulnerable degraded socio residential fabric. Public administrations in big cities and metropolitan areas are confronted with both the undercurrent need of actualization of the built stock and the rise of urban residential vulnerability. The city of Barcelona, as many others, is the result of multiple phenomena with high urban and social consequences. The socio spatial integration of immigrant population, the touristic rise and gentrification processes are current situations simultaneously taking place in the city. In parallel, a framework of economic crisis in which public investments in urban and social matters decrease, provides a temporal juncture that results into an increase of social polarization and socio economic inequality that becomes evident and expressed in the territory. This research focuses in the case of Barcelona, and presents a methodology based on a system of indicators elaborated through the exploitation of statistical data complemented with very specific data supplied by the Barcelona City Council. The accurate knowledge of socio demographic, socioeconomic and residential and urban characteristics is crucial in order to define the very complex urban dynamics that describe in the city neighbourhoods and areas. Residential vulnerability is defined as an assembly of objective conditions that relate to residential space and indicate situations of social discrimination and structural disadvantage of the population, related to a specific time and context. Thus, it is relevant to analyse the concentration of certain indicators of vulnerability in specific places or neighbourhoods, to contrast its effect on the socio-residential situation and its temporal evolution in order to identify tendencies. The present study contributes to the identification of data sources and a system to calculate the purposed indicators, the elaboration of a GIS analysis in order to determine the characterization of neighbourhoods and census sections according to each indicator, and the identification of areas with a higher degree of problematic based on synthetic analysis. A very relevant knowledge basis that can be used by public policy makers in order to establish measures that define vulnerable areas where to carry out actions that foster urban equality. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The totalitarian times of the 50s-80s of the 20th century have brought the building of high-rise residential blocks in Latvian cities, characterized by an uninteresting solution of standard buildings and the alien scale which does not meet the regional features. During the above period, areas of the residential courtyards have not been addressed. The conclusion of the research is that today the courtyards of the high-rise residential houses have become a stagnant, functionally irrelevant area that forms a depressing nature of the outdoor living space. The uncharted area of courtyards is not being used fully which highlights a wide range of issues that applies to car parks, recreation areas, and the green areas. With the development of the urban infrastructure, the creation of high-rise parking facilities and separate car parks are insufficiently addressed. Consequently, the implementation of improvements in courtyards of high-rise residential houses is not possible if the above issue on the removal of the car load from courtyards is not solved. Many building districts are characterized by the same compositional, architectural-spatial structure which even more influences and causes discomfort in these areas to stay. In recent years, the solution to the above issue is sought by the municipal authorities of Latvia to create a new courtyard zoning. It applies to the project development and construction works. In the research, courtyards of the city of Jelgava are analysed and evaluated which from the qualitative point of view demonstrates and is a vivid example where the issues of the research are readable. The city of Jelgava, located 45 km away from Riga, is an expressed satellite city and serves for the agglomeration of Riga as a huge high-rise residential district. Consequently, the research includes separate courtyards of high-rise residential buildings of the city of Jelgava and their study is carried out from the point of view of the architectural composition and the functional point of view of courtyards. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"Pedestrians affect the traffic in the signalized and un-signalized intersections. Therefore, identifying the behavioural features of the pedestrians is of great importance and may result in better designing facilities for them. In this study, by shooting the four intersections in Rasht for 15 hours and inventory from 4568 pedestrians, crossing speed of the pedestrians in the marked crosswalks and unmarked crosswalks was evaluated and analysed. Results showed that pedestrians′ crossing speed in the marked crosswalks is higher than their crossing speed in the unmarked crosswalks in both signalized and un-signalized intersections. Moreover, in the unmarked crosswalks in the signalized intersections, 15th percentile speed of male pedestrians, female pedestrians and group of pedestrians' decrease 6.4%, 5.4% and 12.2%, respectively, compared with the 15th percentile speed in the marked crosswalks.

Therefore, indoor acceptable comfort is influenced by the architectural design. ISO and ASHRAE standards define thermal comfort as the condition of mind that expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment. The energy demand for heating, beside the building's physical properties, also depend on human behaviour, like opening or closing windows. Generally, windows are the weakest facade element concerning to thermal performance. A lower thermal resistance allows higher thermal conduction through it. When a window is very hot or cold, and the occupant is very close to it, it may result in thermal discomfort. The functionality of a ventilated double window introduces new physical considerations to a traditional window. In consequence, it is necessary to study the local effect on human comfort in function of the boundary conditions. Wind, solar availability, air temperature and therefore heating and indoor air quality conditions will affect the relationship between this passive system and the indoor environment. In the present paper, the influence of thermal performance and ventilation on human comfort resulting from the construction and geometry solutions is shown, helping to choose the best solution. The presented approach shows that in order to save energy it is possible to reduce the air changes of a room to the minimum, without compromising air quality, enhancing simultaneously local thermal performance and comfort. The results of the study on the effect of two parallel windows with a ventilated channel in the same fenestration on comfort conditions for several different room dimensions, are also presented. As the room dimensions' rate changes so does the window to floor rate therefore, under the same climatic conditions and same construction solution, different results are obtained. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'The construction of the public space has become in the last decades something so important and fundamental in the architecture of the cities, that requires a specific discipline and a concrete study that evaluates the characteristics and actions on it. Not already from an urbanistic perspective but from its own design and constructive perspective, with its character as a place for everyone and for everything, must gather a series of elements that are unique to this space. Barcelona is one of the densest cities in the world that, since the end of the s. XX until our days, tries to solve the public space with a design of quality and optimum. The shortage of public space, which also hosts more than eight million tourists each year, makes it necessary to propose a type of meticulous intervention in order to accommodate all types of users and activities. From the first Universal Exhibition of 1888 through 1929 to the 1992 Olympics as the most important stimulus for this renewal of urban space, Barcelona has been rethinking and evolving in the modus operandi in terms of its urban space. From our professional experience as architects both in the municipal, private and university spheres, we believe that it is our responsibility to confer the public space, that is to say, the design of the urban infrastructure with the attributes necessary to consolidate it in a space Suitable for all without exception and as a place of expression of citizenship.

Since the weather condition and traffic characteristics vary every day, the prediction of average speed can be useful in traffic management plans. In this study, traffic and weather data for a two-lane highway located in Northwest of Iran were selected for analysis. After merging traffic and weather data, the linear regression model was calibrated for speed prediction using STATA12.1 Statistical and Data Analysis software. Variables like vehicle flow, percentage of heavy vehicles, vehicle flow in opposing lane, percentage of heavy vehicles in opposing lane, rainfall (mm), snowfall and maximum daily wind speed more than 13m/s were found to be significant variables in the model. Results showed that variables of vehicle flow and heavy vehicle percent acquired the positive coefficient that shows, by increasing these variables the average vehicle speed in every weather condition will also increase. Vehicle flow in opposing lane, percentage of heavy vehicle in opposing lane, rainfall amount (mm), snowfall and maximum daily wind speed more than 13m/s acquired the negative coefficient that shows by increasing these variables, the average vehicle speed will decrease. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The dialogue among the decision makers and stakeholders is a crucial part of any decision-making processes, particularly in case of integrated transportation planning and planning of green infrastructure where a multitude of actors is present. Although the theory of public participation is well-developed after several decades of research, there is still a lack of practical guidelines due to the specificity of public participation challenges. The paper presents a model of public participation for integrated transport and green infrastructure planning for international project TRANSGREEN covering the area of five European countries-Slovakia, Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary and Romania. The challenge of the project is to coordinate the efforts of public actors and NGOs in international environment in oftentimes precarious projects of transport infrastructure building and developing of green infrastructure. The project aims at developing and environmentally-friendly and safe international transport network. The proposed public participation procedure consists of five main steps-spread of information (passive), collection of information (consultation), intermediate discussion, engagement and partnership (empowerment). The initial spread of information is a process of communicating with the stakeholders, informing and educating them and it is based on their willingness to be informed. The methods used in this stage are public displays, newsletters or press releases. The second step of consultation is based on transacting the opinions of stakeholders to the decision makers. Pools, surveys, public hearings or written responses are examples of the multitude of ways to achieve this objective and the main principle of openness of stakeholders. The third step is intermediate discussion where all sides of are invited to a dialogue using the tools such as public meetings, workshops or urban walks. The fourth step is an engagement based on humble negotiation, arbitration and mediation. The collaborative skill needed here is dealing with conflicts. The final step in the procedure is partnership and empowerment employing methods as multi-Actor decision making, voting or referenda. The leading principle is cooperation. In this ultimate step, the stakeholders are becoming decision makers themselves and the success factor here is continuous evaluation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'In our contemporary cities, some public spaces seem to have greater ability to host art interventions, like historical centers, urban sprawl areas, gardens and parks, new residential districts, among others. Also in port cities, its waterfronts constitute privileged spaces for the placement of public art. On Lisbon\\'s riverfront, we can see a relevant number of works and of monuments of strong symbolic nature. In turn, the placement of public art is a way to value the inherently symbolic nature of the waterfronts and to emphasize its monumentality. However, the criteria for the placement of public art on those spaces are not always clear. In some cases, there are some thematic correspondences between the works and the places, namely with the theme of the water, the Discoveries and others like that. Nevertheless, we cannot observe a profound spatial integration, or a design with the context. In some cases, the artistic elements are produced with a logic of isolated work of art and later they are acquired and placed in some public space. In other cases, we assist to an unusual situation: A work is conceived in a strict relation with a place, but then, without any evident justification, it is dislocated to a completely different context. Or simply it is removed, disappearing from the public space. Although it seems a strange situation, such kind of dislocations often occurs in Lisbon. On this framework, this research proposes a discussion about the processes of implementation of public art. We will analyze two cases of public art replacement:1) The monument Primeira Travessia Aérea do Atlântico Sul (First Aerial Crossing of the South Atlantic), by Laranjeira Santos and Rodrigues Fernandes, 1972 and 2) The public sculpture Ribeira das Naus, by Charters de Almeida, 1995. Both works were designed to very specific and important places on Lisbon\\'s waterfront and both were later replaced to other locations on the inner city, quite far from the river. This kind of \"(de)monumentalization\" of a space originates the following questions: why is a work removed from a public space and why it is decided to give it another destination? What are the implications of those changes? Is public art removable? Considering public art besides its purely aesthetic significance, this phenomenon seems to reveal that the physical and the social integration with the place are not always important, or, at least, they are only important in some moments. Also, we can see it from another point of view: A removal or a replacement of a work always reveals specific strategies for certain places, in certain moments. We can thus conclude that the processes of implementation of public art are clearly indicators of the policies and of the dynamics of the cities. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The small and unique building of \"Las Escuelas de San Isidoro\", erected in Padul at the beginning of the 20th century, is a clear example of the new architectural type of the innovative educational model created in Granada by Father Manjón. That model supposed a radical change for the methods of the Spanish teaching and it was the origin of the current educational system. Andrés Manjón y Manjón (1846-1923), priest, jurist and pedagogue, broke with traditional pedagogy and revolutionized the old-fashion model of education that was in vogue until that moment and universalized and socialized education. That pioneer model promoted an education based on aptitudes and faculties, using games and practice, addressed to all ages and social classes, in conjunction with nature. Outdoor education should be used wherever possible. In a historical context of profound social changes, this typology was the answer to the new educational needs using a \"spearing\" architectural language based on a constructive system that was both efficient and economic: Spanish Regionalism. It was a new style from the first third of the 20th century that recreated historical forms. It was far from the breakthrough modern movement that, at that time, it took place in central Europe. However, the model of the Manjonian School runs away from historicist models and remains in the simplicity of brick-faced walls or brick-wrapping walls and masonry drawers, with no more decorative concession that window lintels, jambs and sill jut out. The facades highlight made with simple semicircular arches and some glazed ceramics. Wooden rounded slabs supported on walls and simple wooden cover structures. The steel was barely used in metal structural slabs and brick, and even less on the roof. Architects like Francisco Jiménez Aré valo, Juan Montserrat Pons or Fernando Wilhelmi Manzano will be the architects of this type of architecture that has as a mark of identity the massive use of brick in load walls and as a way to show the facade creating a modest appearance image but of a certain nobility. Wilhelmi projected the Schools of Padul not belonging to the Manjonian type but following a similar way. Conclusion: The knowledge of this architectural typology is basic to protect these simple buildings for educational use, reinforcing the attachment and identity of the citizens of Padul. For them it symbolizes a time and its economic and social context. Through the dissemination in this municipality of the Endof- Grade Projects of the students of the School of Building of the University of Granada related to this building, the following objectives were achieved: revaluing, strengthening and fostering the sense of identity of a village towards one of its most peculiar buildings, The Schools where many of them began their education.

It constitutes the mirror of history, natural and cultural, urban processes, as well as locations of hybrid character, such as degraded and fragmented spaces within the urban fabric or in the city boundaries -areas in between, infrastructures, post-industrial and waterfront sites, but also potential grounds for urban development. Along with the awakening of the global ecological awareness and the ongoing discussion on sustainability issues, the cityscape with its new attributes, constitutes a challenging field of research and planning for various disciplines, further more than landscape architecture, such as architecture, planning, ecology, environment and engineering. This paper focuses on the role of urban landscape architecture, via its theory and practice, in the reshaping of the city territory. It aspires to broaden the discussion concerning the upgrading of the contemporary cities, aiming firstly at the determination of a wider vocabulary for the urban landscape and its design, and secondly at the highlighting of landscape architecture's contribution to the sustainable perspective of urban design and planning. The methodology is based on a comparative research implemented both on a theoretical level and on a level of applied work. Urban landscape architecture is described through theory and practice, along with correlative approaches deriving mainly from landscape urbanism and secondarily from the field of architecture. Urban landscape is approached as a socio-ecological and perceptual legible, a territory of culture, process and production operating as an entity of ecological, infrastructural systems and planning needs, it is also regarded as a precedent for urban development. Furthermore, the research is supported by selected European and International urban landscape projects, presented in a cohesive multiscalar approach, from the node to the region. Theory is reflected upon: a/smaller scale projects-cultural landscapes, b/infrastructural projects, c/extended process territories and d/grand metropolitan projects. The particular case studies constitute representative design approaches dealing with the urban complexity and are hierarchized on qualitative criteria, spatial and functional they are indicative of the spectrum of project's scale, type of intervention -redesign, reclamation, reuse, planning, but also of the project's operational value -cultural, infrastructural, strategic. They stress the importance of landscape's flexible and open-ended nature and ultimately, they underline the crucial role of urban landscape architecture, within transdisciplinarity and sustainable design strategies, in the regeneration of the contemporary cityscape. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," \"This article discusses the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) at the local level of governance in the field of urban planning. It is based on a literature review, in order to define a set of considerations about their use in the urban context and the challenges ahead on this domain. As a starting point, there is the need of rethinking the local governance through the use of ICT related to cities, focused on the modernization of the processes associated with urban planning. Nowadays, in several societies the paradigm about cities if shifting, from an expansionist way of acting towards a regeneration and rehabilitation approach. In the case of Portugal, the local authorities the municipalities are the main responsible for the coordination, and integration of policies with territorial impacts. However, these policies are generally onerous and inefficient, triggering communication and information failures in between local administration and citizens. In this sense, governance should support the decision-making process related to cities' policies, engaging citizens and socio-economic agents. As the main result in this scenario, the use of ICT demonstrates the ability to play an important role in urban planning, by contributing as a simplifying tool, regarding the information and knowledge sharing, gathering local authorities, citizens and socio-economic agents. On the one hand, they promote the reduction of inefficiencies associated to the urban planning process. On the other hand, they boost the development of networks, and consequently the social and territorial cohesion. In summary, the use of ICT infrastructures works as a glue allowing the integration of several intelligence elements of the city, and operating as their base platform. Finally, the literature has revealed that the use of ICT in urban planning should be seen as a means to a wider social goal, and not as an end by itself. With the use of ICT, urban planning authorities are more likely to be aware of the city features in their multiple aspects, being able to define and monitoring the public policies, suitable to each situation, reinforcing the democracy and transparency of local governance. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'Spatial structure of places has gone through significant changes in the last 70 years, caused by modernistic approach towards urban design.

In those structures, a man usually identifies himself with his own house or apartment rather than with space that commonly surrounds him. Therefore, the role of spaces, their image perceived by men and their character is more and more important.

Urban resident and occupant identify himself with the city and urban environment via arrangement of spaces. Social sustainability is an integral part of the effective urban development. Quality of public spaces, which support the city of neighborhoods, vibrant city and short distance city are the important pillars of sustainability.

According to the Order of Cîteaux, only with an austere space, without any distractions, the true spiritual contemplation is achieved. This Order was an aggregator and consolidator pole during the Christian Reconquest. Thus, as it happens with other Religious Orders, Cîteaux has a vast heritage legacy. This heritage is witness, not only of the historical, but also social, political, and spiritual evolution. This legacy resumes the key principles to an austere liturgy, which requirements, in the beginning, are based on the simplicity of worship and of the connection between man and God. Later, these requirements allowed the development of the liturgy itself and its relation with the believers. Consequently, it can be concisely established an empirical approach between the Cistercian churches and the acoustics conditioning of these spaces. This outcome is fundamental in order to understand the connection between liturgy and the conception of the Cistercian churches as well as the constructed space and its history. So, an analysis of these principles is essential to establish the relation between acoustic and religious buildings design throughout history. It is also a mean of understanding the knowledge of acoustics principles that the Cistercian Order bequeathed to Portugal. This paper presents an empirical approach on Cistercian monastic churches acoustics. These spaces are the place where the greatest acoustic efforts are concentrated and it is also the space where the liturgy reaches greater importance. On the other hand, Portugal is a country which has an important Cistercian legacy over several periods of history. Consequently, the Portuguese Cistercian monastic churches are representative of the development of the liturgy, the design of spaces and of the acoustic requirements of their churches since the 12th century until the 21st century and it is of great importance to implement this study. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"Nowadays, urban roundabouts are one of the most popular types of intersections that have grown highly all over the world. Thus, the accurate and engineering design of these types of intersections has a significant effect on improving their traffic performance. The capacity is one of the important traffic parameters in different intersections, which represents the maximum volume of vehicles entering the roundabouts. There are two general methods for determining the capacity of intersections including the use of analytical models such as gap acceptance model and the use of empirical methods (regression model). In the present paper, using the collected data such as entry and circulating volume, both accepted and rejected gaps were studied for three urban roundabouts and the capacity model have been determined by the use of analytical method. After implementation of the data, they became consistent and homogeneous in four different groups and the most optimized range of critical gaps as well as the follow up time were separately determined for each of these groups by using conventional methods such as Sigloch, Raff, Wu, and Harder and according to statistical analyses with a confidence level of 95%. From the obtained results, a range of 3.03 - 3.32 s for critical gap of the studied roundabouts and the range of 1.3 - 1.7 s for follow up time could be mentioned. It was used from the theory of gap acceptance in order to determine urban roundabouts capacity model, in which these gaps have a random nature and follow negative exponential distribution and by conducting this analysis (also has been used by Sigloch), some relations were obtained for determining the capacity of the roundabouts according to the impact of circulating volume and drivers' behaviour. The results indicate that the maximum capacity of the roundabouts in the microscopic models is equal to 2400 veh/h, when the circulating flow rate is reached zero. Moreover, according to the obtained capacity model, the circulating flow never falls down to zero in the case that it reaches its peak value. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'The building sector is primarily responsible for a major part of total energy consumption. The European Energy Performance of Buildings Directives (EPBD) emphasized the need to reduce the energy consumption in buildings, and put forward the rationale for developing Near to Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB). Passive and active strategies help architects to minimize the use of active HVAC systems, taking advantage of the available natural resources such as solar radiation, thermal variability and daylight. The building envelope plays a decisive role in passive and active design strategies. The ideal transparent facade would be one with optical properties, such as Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) and Visible Transmittance (VT), that could readily adapt in response to changing climatic conditions or occupant preferences. The aim of this article consists of describing the system to maintain a small glazed pavilion located in Sofia (Bulgaria) at the desired interior temperature over a whole year. The system comprises i) the use of Water Flow Glazing facades (WFG) and Radiant Interior Walls (RIW), ii) the use of free cooling devices along with traditional heat pump connected to photo-voltaic panels and iii) the use of a new Energy Management System that collects data and acts accordingly by controlling all components. The effect of these strategies and the use of active systems, like Water Flow Glazing, are analysed by means of simulating the prototype over one year. Summer and Winter energy management strategies are discussed in order to change the SHGC value of the Water Flow Glazing and thus, reduce the required energy to maintain comfort conditions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'This work analyses how the built environment affects the quality of the air to be introduced into buildings from light shafts. Several factors such as urban environment and building design intervene in the ability of the light shaft to produce its air change process. Urban areas continuously pollute the air in cities which affects the human health and the environment sustainability. Poor air quality outside buildings supposes a big energy waste to promote an acceptable air quality inside buildings. That requires a large flow rate to maintain the indoor air quality which is translated to an energy efficiency term. The main objective focuses on the impact of standardized architecture design in the quality of the indoor air dependent on the air change in the light shaft. The air change capacity of the outdoor space is numbered analysed using the concept of air change efficiency (ACE). ACE is determined by the built environment, the wind conditions and the design of the building containing light shafts. This concept is comparatively evaluated inside a control domain virtually defined to obtain the mean age of the air for a known air volume. The longer the light shaft in the wind direction is, the better the ACE is compared with other options. Light shafts up to 12 metres high are the most suitable in order to obtain acceptable efficiency results. Other studied cases verify that assumption. Different simplified tools for the technicians to evaluate the design of buildings containing light shafts are proposed. Some strategies of architectural design of buildings with light shafts to be used for ventilation are presented. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"At the end of the 17th century, when the Académie royale d'architecture was created in France, architecture was studied for the first time from a theoretical and analytical point of view. 100 years later, the cole royale des ponts et chaussées was found, also in France. This division of responsibilities within the building discipline varies from country to country and within the specific historical period but, the idea of two professional branches related to architecture, remains to the present day. Through the centuries, this division has been perceived as a problem or as an advantage depending on the specific event, project or construction. However, at the end of the 19th century, when reinforced concrete came into the world of construction, both branches started an interesting collaboration that produced not just marvelous buildings but also helped to evolve architecture. This collaboration started in France and then spread to Spain, Italy and the rest of Europe. As an example of the work that these professionals carried out together was the team formed in the late fifties of the last century by two architects, Bruno Morassutti and Angelo Mangiarotti and an engineer, Aldo Favini. They worked together in Italy projecting amazing and very significant works, such as the Church of Mater Misericordiae which was constructed in Milan between the years 1956 and 1958. One of the main conclusions is that an adequate approach in the collaborative work of architects and engineers, results in impressive and amazing works in which the combination of aesthetic qualities and structural efficiency result in a harmonious building with plenty of significance. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'This investigation shows the European influence on the work of Portuguese architects of the Enlightenment period. Based on previous studies we focus our attention on the design of \"Praça do Comércio\" square and on a hypothesis, that it was based on the French Royal Square. We demonstrate that the design of Lisbon from the second half of the eighteenth-century was influenced by the theories and best practices of the time. We also confirm that the architect Eugénio dos Santos e Carvalho, a member of the reconstruction team for the Baixa, had in his personal library several reference books of French architectural practice that certainly influenced his architecture. The plans for the main square of Lisbon\\'s lower city, \"Praça do Comércio\", can be compared to the \"Place de Nos Conquêtes\", predecessor of the \"Place Vêndome\", in its design, architecture and dimensions. This research analysed the cartography and iconography of Lisbon\\'s reconstruction. In particular, the drawings of \"Praça do Comércio\" and \"Place de nos Conquêtes\" were exhaustively studied. The comparative study of the elements for both squares lead to the conclusion that the Portuguese square presents many aspects of the French Age of Enlightenment, and in particular those featured in the \"Place de nos Conquêtes\". This paper concludes that the Portuguese urban design and architectural projects of the 18th century are the result of previous knowledge where it was always possible to articulate the vernacular with academic design, and where many different influences left their mark on the culture of the period. The plans for the lower part of Lisbon display a mixture of references that relate to architectural and urban planning traditions of the Portuguese military engineering and contemporary French urban planning. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Forecasting of congestion in traffic with Neural Network is an innovative and new process of identification and detection of chaotic features in time series analysis.

Not only because it promotes a less polluted atmosphere among the always dense and busy urban fabric, but also because it avoids several traffic problems. The use of bicycles, or mechanic mechanisms to support the pedestrian mobility is an emerging requirement of cities' quality. In this sense, this article aims to discuss the soft mobility as a requirement of smart cities having as a case study one mountain urban area. It refers to the urban area of Covilhã on the highest mountain of Portugal with nearly two thousand meters high. During the last decades, this city's transformation process has driven to an urban sprawl to the suburbs, increasing the efforts in terms of transportation required by the commuters. In fact, the number of inhabitants living in the city centre is decreasing in favour of the peripheral neighbourhoods. At the same time a set of several mechanic mechanisms such as public lifts, has been built in order to promote a soft pedestrian mobility. However, in many cases, because of the lack of connection and continuity of pedestrian paths in between these mechanisms, they are not allowing a pedestrian mobility network at the city scale. Thus, this paper aims to present a set of good practices in terms of pedestrian mobility network at the city scale, in order to promote a smarter urban environment. The principal results are that soft mobility is a key issue in order to turn cities smarter, among several other factors such as smart economy, smart people, smart governance or smart living. The major conclusions show that the concerns with mobility are key tools to achieve the smart city sustainability, providing and efficient and flexible traveling across the urban fabric, boosting the use of non-polluting ways of mobility. At the same time, there is the conclusion that the underlying areas of development for a smart city, despite its cultural or territorial environments, include several aspects such as reducing the transportation problems as congestion, traffic jams or painful accidents. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'Research presented in this paper gives a brief review of methods used for buildings energy performance modelling. This paper gives also a comprehensive review of the advantages and disadvantages of available methods as well as the input parameters used for modelling buildings energy performance. European Directive EPBD obliges the implementation of energy certification procedure which gives an insight on buildings energy performance via exiting energy certificate databases. Some of the methods for buildings energy performance modelling mentioned in this paper are developed by employing data sets of buildings which have already undergone an energy certification procedure. Such database is used in this paper where the majority of buildings in the database have already gone under some form of partial retrofitting - replacement of windows or installation of thermal insulation but still have poor energy performance. The case study presented in this paper utilizes energy certificates database obtained from residential units in Croatia (over 400 buildings) in order to determine the dependence between buildings energy performance and variables from database by using statistical dependencies tests. Building energy performance in database is presented with building energy efficiency rate (from A+ to G) which is based on specific annual energy needs for heating for referential climatic data [kWh/(m2a)]. Independent variables in database are surfaces and volume of the conditioned part of the building, building shape factor, energy used for heating, CO2 emission, building age and year of reconstruction. Research results presented in this paper give an insight in possibilities of methods used for buildings energy performance modelling. Further on it gives an analysis of dependencies between buildings energy performance as a dependent variable and independent variables from the database.

The traffic model describes the mobility in potentially-captable future southern traffic relationships and allows the calculation of savings in travelled distance and travel times on the current situation. The traffic model allows to know different behaviours of the possible alternatives in the construction of a new high-capacity road. The model is able to select the one which captures more traffic and produces a bigger saving in travel time, meaning, the one which produces a better socioeconomic improvement. The research concludes in favour of the nearest corridor to the city centre, being this one the more crowded and the one that produces greater time savings. It is also the corridor that allows giving the Southern Bypass a dual purpose of collectingdistributing in the city of Badajoz. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The city waste is one of the main urban problems to be solved, since they generate large impacts on the environment, like use of land, contamination of the soil, water and air, and human diseases, among others. In Rosario city, placed in the Argentina Humid Pampa and having about 1 million inhabitants, the Municipality is developing different strategies in order to reduce the waste impact (295 000 Tons in 2016). One of the most important actions was the construction of the Bella Vista compost plant in 2012 (within the largest in South America). In the present work we analysed the possibility to use urban organic waste (that for Rosario city represents about 58% of the total waste in the last years) for: A) compost production and b) biogas production, with compost as a by-product. We determined the produced compost and biogas and the corresponding greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, considering three possible scenarios: A reference scenario (Sr ) where 24 100 Tons of urban solid waste per year is transported from the city houses and buildings to a transfer landfill and then to the a final disposal landfill a scenario number one (S1 ) in which the same fraction of waste is transported to the Compost plant and transformed to compost and a scenario number two (S2 ) where the same quantity of waste is used for the production of biogas (and compost). Applying the IPCC 2006 Model, we compare the results of the annual GHG emissions, in order to select the best alternative: To expand the Compost plant or to build a Biogas (plus compost) plant. We also discussed the extension of the present analysis to the situation in which all the capability of the Compost plant (25% of the 2016 waste production of the city) is used and the impact these plants are having for a better quality of life of persons involved in the informal waste activity. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"This article intends to explore the limits of scanning with the technology of 3D Laser Scanner and the 3D printing, as an approximation to its application for the survey and the study of singular elements of the architectural heritage. The case study we developed is the Porta del Drac, in the Pavelló Güell, designed by Antoni Gaudí. We divided the process in two parts, one about how to scan and optimize the survey with the Laser Scanner Technology, made with a Faro Forus3D x330 scanner. The second one, about the optimization of the survey as a high-resolution mesh to have a scaled 3D model to be printed in 3D, for the musealization of the Verdaguer House of Literature in Vil.la Joana (Barcelona), a project developed by the Museum of History of Barcelona, in tribute to Jacint Verdaguer. In the first place, we propose a methodology for the survey of this atypical model, which is of special interest for several factors: The geometric complexity in relation to the occlusions, the thickness of the metallic surfaces, the hidden internal structure partially seen from the outside, the produced noise in its interior, and the instrumental errors. These factors make the survey process complex from the data collection, having to perform several scans from different positions to cover the entire sculpture, which has a geometry composed of a variety of folds that cause occlusions. Also, the union of the positions and the average of the surfaces is of great relevance, since the elements of the sculpture are constructed by a metal plate of 2mm, therefore, the error in the union of all these many positions must be smaller than this. Moreover, optimization of the cloud has a great difficulty because of the noise created by the instrumental error as it is a metal sculpture and because of noise point clouds that are generated inside the internal folds of the wings, which are made with a welded wire mesh with little spaces between them. Finally, the added difficulty that there is an internal structure between elements of the parts of the Drac that are partially hidden and therefore cannot be recorded. Secondly, we expose the procedures performed to move from a point cloud to an optimal high-resolution mesh to be printed in 3D, adapting it to all the limitations that this printing technique entails. On the one hand, for the meshing process, a previous classification of the point cloud by pieces (wings, chains, mosaics, head ..) is made and an internal structure is re-Assembled to avoid floating parts. On the other hand, the selection of the 3D printing technique, in this case FDM (Fused Deposition Modelling), limits the size of the model so it needs to be cut by determined maximum dimension, and also it limits the minimum thickness of the model's surface, that is to say, the model cannot be directly scaled to the desired size because the 2mm surfaces would be too thin to be printed. This research intends to advance the knowledge of data acquisition, optimization, modelling and 3D printing, with a case study of great complexity. A process that can be systematized and applied to other models. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'Natural light in the Cistercian churches is closely linked not only with the liturgical requirements at the \"officium\" but also with the canonical hours based on the ora et labora dictated by the Rule of St. Benedict. The Cistercian architecture, in its beginnings (12th century forward) is characterized by austerity, simplicity and the play of light and shadow that gives value to the monastic architectural space itself, making it perfect for a contemplative experience. In the Cistercian Monastery the church is the central piece of the monastic building. Nave, transept and apse are the main architectural components to which is added the choir. This paper contextualizes the importance and close connections of natural light, within the Cistercian Monasteries architecture. Thus the essence of daylight is analysed within the Church of the Monastery of S. Bento de Cástris, in Évora, Portugal. This former Monastery (13th-19th centuries) includes the church, at the south-eastern corner which has not only a high choir, but also a low lateral choir (within the presbytery). Its unchanged exterior walls are made of solid masonry. Although the function of the walls is primarily structural, the windows allow the daylight to penetrate the space of the church. The church has two external façades facing northeast and southeast. The combined orientation effect of the church\\'s main axis and the sun trajectory determines how the sunlight reaches the interior of this architectural structure. This study presents the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the luminous environment in the church of S. Bento de Cástris, being the first based on the authors\\' perception of the effect of the daylight within the different areas of the enclosed space. The appreciation of the spatial experiences was supported by quantitative daylight simulations that were conducted in selected areas within the space. With this paper is intended to contribute to the debate about the specificity of daylight, in the context of Cistercian architecture. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC) is a material that is attracting attention in the construction industry due to the high mechanical strength and durability, leading to structures having low maintenance requirements. The production of UHPC, however, has generally higher environmental impact than normal strength concrete due to the increased demand of cement required in the concrete mix. What is still not sufficiently investigated, is if the longer lifetime, slimmer construction and lower maintenance requirements lead to a net environmental benefit compared to standard concrete bridge design. This study utilizes life cycle assessment (LCA) to determine the lifetime impacts of two comparable highway crossing footbridges spanning 40 meters, designed respectively with UHPC and normal strength concrete. The results of the study show that UHPC is an effective material for reducing lifetime emissions from construction and maintenance of long lasting infrastructure, as the UHPC design outperforms the normal strength concrete bridge in most impact categories. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The presence of taxi stops within the area of signalized intersections at the outlet legs due to unnatural behaviour of the taxis, sudden change of lanes, parking manoeuvres activities and stopping the vehicle to discharge or pick up the passengers have led to reduction of saturation flow rate at the outlet leg of signalized intersections and increased delay as well as affecting the performance of a crossing lane. So far, in term of evaluating effective adjustment factors on saturation flow rate at the inlet legs of the signalized intersections, various studies have been carried out, however there has not been any studies on effective adjustment factors on saturation flow rate at the inlet legs. Hence, the evaluating of the traffic effects of unique behaviours on the saturation flow rate of the outlet leg is very important. In this research the parking manoeuvre time and taxi blockage time were evaluated and analyzed based on the available lane width as well as determining the effective adjustment factors on the saturation flow rate using recording related data at four signalized intersections in Rasht city. The results show that the average parking manoeuvre time is a function of the lane width and is increased as the lane width is reduced. Also, it is suggested to use the values of 7.37 and 11.31 seconds, respectively for the average parking manoeuvre time and the average blockage time of taxies at the outlet legs of signalized intersections for the traffic designing in Rasht city. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Providing an inclusive transport system is a global ambition. Whereas, mobility needs and mobility barriers of people suffering from a physical impairment have already been observed frequently, people suffering from mental impairments (due to e.g. anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, dementia or other degenerative diseases) are often overlooked. Numerous studies already suggest that the number of people with mental impairment will significantly increase due to the demographic change and is also shown by the prevalence of mental diseases. Whereby, not even the data collected do necessarily give the full picture of the actual situation. Thus, the importance of mobility needs and mobility problems of people with mental impairments will gain dramatically. Participating in the transport system is a basic need that furthermore requires the ability of adopting different roles (e.g. driver, pedestrian). Due to explanatory studies of the authors, it could be shown what kind of problems people with mental impairment are faced with while participating in the transport system or interacting in public space. Thus, these studies represent the first step that is needed to consider the specific needs of people with mental impairments in future planning. The identified problems of people who are suffering from mental impairment are various. Thereby it can be distinguished between problems triggered by structural (e.g. absence of emergency buttons, spacious stations), organisational (e.g. absence of security stuff, lacking information according time table of transit) or social conditions (e.g. crowed places or vehicles, stigmatisation).

Location of bus stops is a complicated subject by reducing distances between stops, walking time decreases, but the total travel time may increase. In this paper, a specified corridor in the city of Rasht in north of Iran is studied. Firstly, a new formula is presented to calculate the travel time, by which the number of stops and consequently, the travel time can be optimized. An intended corridor with specified number of stops and distances between them is addressed, the related formulas to travel time are created, and its travel time is calculated. Then the corridor is modelled using a meta-heuristic method in order that the placement and the optimal distances of bus stops for that are determined. It was found that alighting and boarding time along with bus capacity are the most effective factors affecting travel time. Consequently, it is better to have more concentration on indicated factors for improving the efficiency of bus system. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The article deals with the development plans and possibilities of the Bratislava north-west expansion direction.

Uniformity of the amplitudes can be a challenge as the welding area increases. Therefore, design a welding horn in order to obtain the uniform amplitudes at the large area is significant difficult. This work presents a method for obtaining the uniform amplitudes at the working surface of the stepped wide-blade horn.

The stress distribution and deformation of wind turbine blade were obtained by considering different pitch angles and at different angular positions. The Tsai-Hill criterion was used to determine the failure of wind turbine blade. The results show that at the 0° pitch angle, the wind turbine blade is subjected to the largest combined load and therefore the stress is the largest with the increasing pitch angle, the load gradually decreases and the stress is also smaller. The stress and displacement are the greatest when the wind blade is located at 120° angular position from its highest vertex. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'This research will deal with the analysis and design of an anti-theft bicycle. At the first, the structure of the bicycle lock device will be focused. Therefore, all related academic journals, dissertations, and patent were collected, ordered, classified, and analysis in order to understand the phase of the developing tendency towards the bicycle lock apparatus presently. Nowadays, a wave of riding bicycles all over the world is quite prevailing. Also, the bicycles incline to be high-price sporting and recreational equipment. Due to this, the rate of stolen bicycles has increased as well. Even though there are many different types of bicycle locks sold on the market, they are unable to work out effectively to prevent from being stolen because they are easy to be broken. In this case, the target design in this research will be mainly put on the simple structure and facile use enabling users feeling secure to park their bicycles.

This algorithm is applied to the inverse determination of elastic constants of three composite plates by combining numerical method and vibration testing. For these problems, the proposed algorithm could find better elastic constants in less computation cost.

The redesign includes the structural redesign and operational redesign. After completing the process successfully, the redesigned MagJet is subjected to testing. The effect of backpressure from a commercial syringe pump is evident. The operating frequency with backpressure reaches up to 1.5 kHz, although that without backpressure is 650 Hz. The droplet size at a frequency of 800 Hz is about 53 μm, less than half of the nozzle size. It can be concluded that various droplets can be made by combining frequency with a proper flow rate. Backpressure prevents the MagJet from air inclusion in the nozzle, so continuous ejection of the droplets are possible. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'A micro drill structure was optimized to give minimum lateral displacement at its drill tip, which plays an extremely important role on the quality of drilled holes. A drilling system includes a spindle, chuck and micro drill bit, which are modeled as rotating Timoshenko beam elements considering axial drilling force, torque, gyroscopic moments, eccentricity and bearing reaction force. Based on our previous work, the lateral vibration at the drill tip is evaluated. It is treated as an objective function in the optimization problem. Design variables are diameter and lengths of cylindrical and conical parts of the micro drill, along with nonlinear constraints on its mass and mass center location. Results showed that the lateral vibration was reduced by 15.83 % at a cutting speed of 70000 rpm as compared to that for a commercial UNION drill. Among the design variables, we found that the length of the conical part connecting to the drill shank plays the most important factor on the lateral vibration during cutting process. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Damage mechanisms in hot metal forming processes are accelerated by mechanical stresses arising during Thermal and mechanical properties variations, because it consists of the materials with different thermal and mechanical loadings and swelling coefficients.

As such, it is advantageous to study joint torques that arise due to electrical stimulation of muscle, to measure fatigue in an indirect, minimally-invasive way. Dynamometry is one way in which this can be achieved. In this paper, torque data is presented from an FES experiment on quadriceps, using isometric dynamometry to measure torque. A library of fatigue metrics to quantify these data are put forward. These metrics include start and end torque peaks, percentage changes in torque over time, and maximum and minimum torque period algorithms (MTPA 1 and 2), and associated torque-time plots. It is illustrated, by example, how this novel library of metrics can model fatigue over time. Furthermore, these methods are critiqued by a qualitative assessment and compared against one another for their utility in modelling fatigue. Linear trendlines with coefficients of correlation (R 2) and qualitative descriptions of data are used to achieve this. We find that although arduous, individual peak plots yield the most relevant values upon which fatigue can be assessed. Methods to calculate peaks in data have less of a utility, offset by an order of magnitude of ∼101 in comparison with theoretically expected peak numbers. In light of this, we suggest that future methods would be well-inclined to investigate optimized form of peak analysis. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Double-diffusive natural convection in porous layer saturated with a binary fluid is presented in this study. The layer is anisotropic with respect to both its permeability and diffusivity and is inclined with respect to the horizontal axis. The vertical walls of porous cavity are subjected to uniform temperature and concentration where the other surfaces are assumed to be adiabatic and impermeable. The governing equations are solved by the finite volume method. The study focuses on the effects of anisotropy in permeability and the inclination angle of the flow structures on heat and mass transfer. The results are presented and analyzed in terms of streamlines, isotherms, isoconcentrations lines and average Nusselt and Sherwood numbers. They indicate the existence of three regimes. A diffusive regime, a transition regime and an asymptotic regime.

This one-pot preparation methods include the dispersion of GO (or GO plus CNT) in a solution of monomers and the subsequent polymerization. The texture of the nanocomposites was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), where very compact surfaces are observed suggesting good dispersion of GO sheets and CNTs within the polymer matrix. The presence of GO inside the polymer network diminished the equilibrium swelling values and increased the elastic modulus up to 162 % with respect to the pure gel. Similar results were observed for the composite with CNT. Furthermore, the electrical resistivity of PNIPAm-GO diminishes as the applied compression force increases, being 50 % lower than hydrogel without GO. Moreover, the electrochemical properties of the hydrogels, evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, indicate highly reversible electrical charge/discharge response. In order to apply these materials for antibiotic delivery, the absorption of tetracycline (tet) is evaluated and the nanocomposites showed better absorption capability and improved antibiotic delivery.

However, the process can involve some complications due to the rapid heating and cooling of the material processed, resulting in physical and metallurgical effects as thermal contraction during solidification, giving as a result the presence of residual stresses in the narrow weld. Formation of defects during the process is an important topic to be evaluated in order to achieve better performance of the steels in use. In the present work, defects formed during laser welding of a structural steel have been investigated. The defects formed have been identified and the causes of the defects are discussed. Possible strategies for improvement of the welding procedure and final weld result are proposed. The defects were analysed by optical and scanning electron microscopy and hardness measurement. Cracks were located in the middle of the fusion zone and followed both inter-granular and trans-granular paths. Impurities as manganese sulphides were found along the welding direction, and could act as sites for crack formation. The cracks formed during solidification of the weld are identified as solidification cracks. This kind of cracks is usually caused by solidification shrinkage and thermal contractions during the process, which appear in the fusion zone and sometimes in the heat affected zone. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'This paper focuses on the long-Term monitoring of thermal comfort and discomfort parameters in five small test buildings equipped with different heating and cooling systems.

While, in Latvian climate conditions overheating is not a big issue in traditional buildings since it happens only a couple of weeks per year air conditioners must still be installed to maintain thermal comfort. The need for cooling in recently built office buildings with large window area can increase significantly. It is therefore of great interest if the thermal comfort conditions can be maintained by PCMs alone or with reduced maximum power of installed cooling systems. Our initial studies show that if the test building is well-insulated (necessary to reduce heat loss in winter), phase change material is not able to solidify fast enough during the relatively short night time.

In that way, a novel form-stable PCM based on bricks was developed. In order to study the incorporation of the thermoregulatory material in the composites, bricks with different porosities have been manufactured. In this work the ssPCM was synthesized using polyethylene glycol (PEG) as PCM and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as supporter precursor by sol-gel method. The initial liquid product can be further turned into solid by neutralization procedures. ssPCM in its liquid form is adsorbed inside the porous brick by capillary action and it is further stabilized by controlling its gelation time, obtaining the new form-stable PCM. The adsorption curves, the long-Term stability after 100 cycles of heating and cooling processes and the improved thermal energy storage capacities for the obtained samples have been studied. Different composites containing between 15 to 110 wt% of ssPCM respect to the initial dried mass of brick have been obtained, with thermal capacities within 8.94 to 28.80 kWh/m3.

The present study compares the thermal behavior of seven different building prototypes tested under Mediterranean climate: Two of them were built with sustainable earth-based construction systems and the other five, with conventional brick construction systems. The tested earth-based construction systems consist of rammed earth walls and wooden green roofs, which have been adapted to contemporary requirements by reducing their thickness. In order to balance the thermal response, wooden insulation panels were placed in one of the earth prototypes. All building prototypes have the same inner dimensions and orientation, and they are fully monitored to register inner temperature and humidity, surface walls temperatures and temperatures inside walls. Furthermore, all building prototypes are equipped with a heat pump and an electricity meter to measure the electrical energy consumed to maintain a certain level of comfort. The experimentation was performed along a whole year by carrying out several experiments in free floating and controlled temperature conditions. This study aims at demonstrating that sustainable construction systems can behave similarly or even better than conventional ones under summer and winter conditions. Results show that thermal behavior is strongly penalized when rammed earth wall thickness is reduced. However, the addition of 6 cm of wooden insulation panels in the outer surface of the building prototype successfully improves the thermal response. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Due to the growing amount of residues in Europe, it is mandatory to provide a viable alternative for managing wastes contributing to the efficient use of resources. Besides, it is also essential to move towards a low carbon economy, priority EU by 2050. Among these, it is important to highlight the development of sustainable alternatives capable of incorporating different kind of wastes in their formulations.Municipal Solid Waste Incineration (MSWI) is estimated to increase in Europe, where the accessibility of landfill is restricted. Bottom ash (BA) is the most significant by-product from MSWI as it accounts for 85-95 % of the solid product resulting from combustion. BA is a mixture of calcium-rich compounds and others silicates enriched in iron and sodium. In addition, it is categorized as non-hazardous waste which can be revalorized as secondary material in construction or civil engineering fields, previous weathering stabilization during 2-3 months. Taking into account the relative proportion of each size fraction and the corresponding material characterization, the content of glass (primary and secondary) is estimated to be around 60 wt%. Furthermore, as a renewable resource and according to waste management European policies, residual agricultural biomass has attracted attention in preparation of advanced materials for various applications, due to their low cost, abundance, and environment friendliness. Among this residual biomass, rice husk is a by-product of rice milling industry which has high content of silica and has been widely used in buildings as natural thermal insulation material.Weathered BA (WBA) with a particle size less than 30 mm was milled under 100 μm, mixed with 2.0-5.0 mm rice husk, formed into ball-shaped pellets and sintered by different thermal treatments, which remove the organic matter content generating a large porosity. Physico-chemical analysis and mechanical behavior of the manufactured lightweight aggregates were tested. The obtained results provide a suitable physico-mechanical formulation using WBA as silica source, as well as a common crop by-product. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'A strong engineering interest in nanostructured conducting polymers and its composite materials have been widely used to build various sensor devices, electronic interconnect devices, fuel cells and batteries.

Multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)/polyethylene oxide (PEO) and graphene nanosheets (GR)/PEO composites and composite of MWCNT/GR/PEO were prepared by solution casting and hot-pressing method. Composites were plasticized by 5% of Lithium triflate (LiTrifl), which play role of additional ion source in conducting polymer composite. Mechanical tensile tests were performed to evaluate nanoparticles influence on the mechanical strength of the conductive polymer composite materials. Difference of tensile tests of prepared composition can be seen from tensile tests data curves.

The EG granular aggregate is produced by using recycled glass and blowing agents, melted down in high temperature. The unique structure of the EG granules is obtained where the air is kept closed inside the pellet. The use of the porous aggregate in the preparation process of the FC samples provides an opportunity to improve some physical and mechanical properties of the FC, classifying it as a product of high-performance. In this research the FC samples were produced by adding the EG granules and the CS. The capillary water absorption of hardened samples has been verified. The pore size distribution has been determined by microscope. It is a very important characteristic, specifically in the cold climate territories-where temperature often falls below zero degrees. It is necessary to prevent forming of the micro sized pores in the final structure of the material as it reduces its water absorption capacity. In addition, at a below zero temperature water inside these micro sized pores can increase them by expanding the stress on their walls during the freezing process.

Replacing cement with the pozzolanic additives in most cases has resulted not only in positive impact on the environment but also has improved strength and durability of the concrete. Effective pozzolanic additives can be obtained from natural resources such as volcanic ashes, kaolin and other sediments as well as from different production industries that create various by-products with high pozzolanic reactivity. Current research deals with effectiveness evaluation of various mineral additives/wastes, such as coal combustion bottom ash, barley bottom ash, waste glass and metakaolin containing waste as well as calcined illite clays as supplementary cementitious materials, to be used in concrete production as partial cement replacement. Most of the examined materials are used as waste stream materials with potential reactive effect on the concrete. Milling time and fineness of the tested supplementary material has been evaluated and effectiveness was detected. Results indicate that fineness of the tested materials has crucial effect on the concrete compressive strength index. Not in all cases the prolonged milling time can increase fineness and reactivity of the supplementary materials however the optimal milling time and fineness of the pozolanic additives increased the strength index of concrete up to 1.16 comparing to reference, even in cases when cement was substituted by 20 w%. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Experimental measurements of Seasonal Coefficient of Performance (SCOP) for heating of 160 m2 household in Riga were conducted for operation of brine-water heat pump with vertical ground heat exchangers (GHE).

However, this consumption can be reduced by between 30% and 80% through commercially available technologies. The consumption of energy in the dwellings is mostly associated with the heating and cooling of the interior environment. One solution to reduce these consumptions is the implementation of technologies and Phase Change Materials (PCMs) for Thermal Energy Storage (TES). So, the aim of this work is to analyse the advantages, in terms of decreasing energy consumption, associated with the application of PCMs in Portuguese residential buildings. For this, eight PCMs with different melting ranges were analysed. These materials were analysed through a dynamic simulation performed with EnergyPlus software.

Paraffin and fatty acids are some of the most used PCM in TES systems, as they have high phase change enthalpy and in addition they do not present subcooling nor hysteresis and have proper cycling stability. The simulations and design of TES systems require the knowledge of the thermophysical properties of PCM. Thermal conductivity, viscosity, specific heat capacity (Cp) can be experimentally determined, but these are material and time consuming tasks. To avoid or to reduce them, and to have reliable data without the need of experimentation, thermal properties can be calculated by empirical equations. In this study, five different equations are given to calculate the viscosity and specific heat capacity of fatty acid PCM and paraffin PCM. Two of these equations concern, respectively, the empirical calculation of the viscosity and liquid Cp of the whole paraffin PCM family, while the other three equations presented are for the corresponding calculation of viscosity, solid Cp, liquid Cp of the whole fatty acid family of PCM. Therefore, this study summarize the work performed to obtain the main empirical equations to measure the above mentioned properties for whole fatty acid PCM family and whole paraffin PCM family. Moreover, empirical equations have been obtained to calculate these properties for other materials of these PCM groups and these empirical equations can be extrapolated for PCM with higher or lower phase change temperatures within a lower relative error 4%. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Membranes are widely used for the treatment of various solutions.

Since lack of phosphorus may hinder the growth of microorganisms, the aim of this research is to evaluate the effect of microbially available phosphorus (MAP) removal via affordable water pre-Treatment methods (adsorption, biofiltration, electrocoagulation) on bacterial growth. Four cylindrical reactors were installed at an artificially recharged groundwater station. Further temperature influence and carbon limitation were tested for biofiltration technology. The amount of MAP and total cell count was measured by flow cytometry. The results showed that at lower temperatures electrocoagulation performed the best, resulting in complete MAP removal (detection limit 6.27x10-3μg P l-1). Sorbent demonstrated MAP removal of 70-90%. Biomass did not have any noteworthy results at +8°C, however, at +19°C MAP removal of around 80% was achieved. Main conclusions obtained within this study are: (i) tested technologies effectively eliminate MAP levels (ii) temperature has a significant effect on MAP removal in a bioreactor, (iii) multi-barrier approach might be necessary for better P limitation that might prolong operating time of a membrane. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Glass fiber reinforced concrete (GRC) opens the door for lightweight and complex shaped innovative construction, adding architectural value to buildings.

Experiments in a flume, our method for scour calculation and computer modelling results confirm a considerable impact of the contraction rate of the flow, the discharge redistribution between channel and floodplain, the local velocity, backwater and river bed layering on the depth, width, and volume of scour hole in steady and unsteady flow, under clear water condition. With increase of the contraction rate of the flow, the discharge redistribution between channel and floodplain, the local velocity, backwater values, the scour depth increases. At the same contraction rate, but at a different Fr number, the scour depth is different: with increase in the Fr number, the local velocity, backwater, scour depth, width, and volume is increasing. Acceptance of the geometrical contraction of the flow, approach velocity and top sand layer of the river bed for scour depth calculation as accepted now, may be the reason of the structures failure and human life losses. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Calcium nitrate in mortars and concrete is used as a multifunctional additive: As set accelerator, plasticizer, long term strength enhancer and as antifreeze admixture.

To provide services for coordinate determination, Network-based Real Time Kinematic (NRTK) system called \"LatPos\" has been established and operated in Latvia since 2006. One of the factors, affecting the performance of LatPos system services, is activity of ionosphere. Ionosphere is a region of the earth\\'s atmosphere, from about 60 kilometers up to 1000 km above the earth\\'s surface, in which there is a high concentration of free electrons, spatially variated, affected by space weather, seasonal and solar cycle changes. Ionospheric activity conditions depending on mentioned factors can be analyzed by LatPos system data. Some data processing strategies has been developed and LatPos RTK network performance results obtained, during different ionospheric activity conditions. This paper focused on both segments: The NRTK performance and the rover receiver coordinate determination possibilities in field when high ionospheric activity occurs. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Alkali-Activated materials (AAM) exhibit remarkable high-Temperature resistance which makes them perspective materials for high-Temperature applications, for instance as fire protecting and insulating materials in industrial furnaces. Series of experiments were carried out to develop optimum mix proportions of AAM based on chamotte with quartz sand (Q), olivine sand (OL) and firebrick sawing residues (K26) as fillers. Aluminium scrap recycling waste was considered as a pore forming agent and 6M NaOH alkali activation solution has been used. Lightweight porous AAM have been obtained with density in range from 600 to 880 kg/m3 and compressive strength from 0.8 to 2.7 MPa. The XRD and high temperature optical microscopy was used to characterize the performance of AAM. The mechanical, physical and structural properties of the AAM were determined after the exposure to elevated temperatures at 800 and 1000°C. The results indicate that most promising results for AAM were with K26 filler where strength increase was observed while Q and OL filler reduced mechanical properties due to structure deterioration caused by expansive nature of selected filler. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Modal analysis in continuum mechanics is widely used in damage detection, quality control and to validate numerical simulations. Peridynamics is a reformulation of continuum mechanics that allow discontinuities, such as cracks and voids, to arise and propagate without any special techniques, however, modal analysis in peridynamics has not been explored in detail. In this study we simulate the modal response of an aluminium plate with clamped-free boundary conditions in peridynamics, and compare results to a FE simulation and an experimental modal test. The natural frequencies from peridynamics agree better with the experimental results than frequencies from finite-elements for all modes except mode 1. Differences between peridynamic and experimental results ranged (in magnitude) from 0.13% to 10.38%, and between peridynamic and finite-element results from 0.23% to 9.72%. All mode shapes calculated in peridynamics corresponded to those from finite-elements and experimental measurements. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'An investigation of the forms of shell buckling has been the subject of many experimental and theoretical studies. On the basis of analysing of the forms of equilibrium it is possible to determine the stability of a structure as a whole, especially if a statistical analysis is used. The numerical analysis of the shells considered is based on a semi-Analytical treatment of displacement and stress field. This method is proven for static and dynamic nonlinear analysis of general shells of revolution and leads to important advantages in efficiency and accuracy compared with a common finite element analysis, especially in the case of geometrically imperfect shells.

The effect of PNC-HEMA for improving the flame retardant properties of the microcapsules were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). It was found that the thermal energy storage (TES) capacity of the microcapsules increased in the presence of PNC-HEMA. However, the morphology of the microcapsules became irregular when the content of monomer with flame retardant properties was increased. Thermogravimetric analysis performed under atmospheric air confirmed that the PNC-HEMA raised the amount of residue after the burning process, proving the formation of thermally stable char. Thus, these materials could be considered as an important alternative to commonly used microcapsules containing phase change materials (PCMs), where a lower flammability is required for their application. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'This study researches compressive strength and durability of the high strength self-compacting concrete (SCC) impacted at early stage by the curing conditions. The mixture compositions of metakaolin containing waste and cenospheres as partial cement replacement (15 wt%) were compared to reference SCC with 100% cement. The specimens prepared in advance were demoulded 24h after casting of the SCC and the specific curing conditions were applied for up to 28 days: standard water curing at 20°C (i) indoor curing at 20°C, RH 60% (ii) and low temperature air curing (2°C) at RH 60% (iii). Results indicate that at early stage (14 days) indoor curing conditions increase compressive strength of the SCC whilst no strength loss has been detected even at a low temperature curing. The further strength gain has been substantially reduced for samples cured indoor and at a low temperature with significant variation observed for long term compressive strength (180 days). The metakaolin containing waste has proved to be an effective partial cement replacement and it has improved strength gain even at a low temperature curing. Meanwhile cenospheres have reduced the SCC strength and with no positive effect on strength observed within the standard term. Freeze-Thaw durability and resistance to the chloride penetration have been improved for the SCC cured at low temperature. The SCC with metakaolin containing waste has proved to be the most durable thus demonstrating importance of effective micro filler use. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"To maintain comfort conditions in residential buildings along a full year period, the use of active systems is generally required to either supply heating or cooling. The heating and cooling demands strongly depend on the climatic conditions, type of building and occupants' behaviour. The overall annual energy consumption of the building can be reduced by the use of renewable energy sources and/or passive systems. The use of phase change materials (PCM) as passive systems in buildings enhances the thermal mass of the envelope, and reduces the indoor temperature fluctuations. As a consequence, the overall energy consumption of the building is generally lower as compared to the case when no PCM systems are used. The selection of the PCM melting temperature is a key issue to reduce the energy consumption of the buildings. The main focus of this study is to determine the optimum PCM melting temperature for passive heating and cooling according to different weather conditions. To achieve that, numerical simulations were carried out using EnergyPlus v8.4 coupled with GenOpt® v3.1.1 (a generic optimization software). A multi-family residential apartment was selected from ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2013 prototype building model, and different climate conditions were considered to determine the optimum melting temperature (in the range from 20C to 26°C) of the PCM contained in gypsum panels. The results confirm that the optimum melting temperature of the PCM strongly depends on the climatic conditions. In general, in cooling dominant climates the optimum PCM temperature is around 26°C, while in heating dominant climates it is around 20C. Furthermore, the results show that an adequate selection of the PCM as passive system in building envelope can provide important energy savings for both heating dominant and cooling dominant regions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," 'The investigation was carried out to know the effect of waste steel shavings on the bond resistance between concrete and steel reinforcement using 16mm and 20mm diameter high-yield reinforcing bars.

Especially high density polyethylene (HDPE) turned out to be suitable as was shown by detailed thermophysical characterization including more than 1000 heating and cooling cycles for INEOS Rigidex HD6070EA.

In total we performed 30 melting and crystallization cycles where the whole storage was above 100 °C for more than 140 hours. After usage we examined the interior of the storage by cutting it into various pieces. A thin layer of degradation was observed on the surfaces of the PCM which is most likely related to thermo-oxidative degeneration of HDPE.

While weathered bottom ash (WBA) is considered a non-hazardous residue that can be revalorized as a secondary aggregate, APC fly ashes generated during the flue gas treatment are classified as hazardous waste and are handled in landfill disposal after stabilization, usually with Portland cement (OPC). However, taking into account the amount of APC residues produced and the disposing cost in landfill, their revalorization is an important issue that could be effectively addressed. As MSW can be incinerated producing bottom ashes (BA) or air pollutant control (APC) residues, the development of a mortar formulated with APC fly ash as secondary building material is a significant risk to the environment for their content of heavy metals. In this way, Design of Experiment (DoE) was used for the improvement of granular material (GM) formulation composed by APC and OPC for further uses as road sub-base aggregate. DoE analysis was successful in the modelling and optimization the formulation as function of the mechanical properties and APC amount. Consequently, an optimal mortar formulation (OMF) of around 50 wt.% APC and 50 wt.% OPC was considered. The OMF leachates and abrasion resistance have been analyzed. These results have demonstrated the viability of OMF as non-hazardous material feasible to be used as secondary aggregate. Moreover, it would be possible to consider the environmental assessment of a GM composed by ≈20 wt.% of OMF and ≈80 wt.% of WBA in order to improve mechanical properties and heavy metals stabilization. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'In the presented paper there are investigated the basic problems of the local system of SHM of large scale aircraft component.

The low conductivity gives rise to limited power during charging and discharging TES. Impregnating metal foam with PCM, however, has been found to enhance the heat transfer. On the other hand, the effect of foam parameters such as porosity, pore size and material type has remained unclear. In this paper, the effect of these foam parameters on the solidification time is investigated. Different samples of PCM-impregnated metal foam were experimentally tested and compared to one without metal foam. The samples varied with respect to choice of material, porosity and pore size. They were placed in a rectangular cavity and cooled from one side using a coolant flowing through a cold plate. The other sides of the rectangular cavity were Polymethyl Methacrylate (PM) walls exposed to ambient. The temperature on the exterior walls of the cavity was monitored as well as the coolant flow rate and its temperature. The metal foam inserts reduced the solidification times by at least 25 %. However, the difference between the best performing and worst performing metal foam is about 28 %.

Researchers have spent significant effort in order to understand phenomena associated with this component, but there are still several issues to address, in part because new technology development and design trends continually lead to new challenges, among which weight reduction is crucial. For shock absorbers, weight reduction is related to the use of new materials (e.g. composite) or new design paradigms (e.g. more complex geometry, wall thickness, etc.). All of them are directly linked to wall compliance values higher than the actual ones. The present article proposes a first analysis of the phenomena introduced by a high wall compliance, through a modelling approach and various simulations in order to understand the vehicle behaviour changes. It is shown that high values of wall compliance lead to increased hysteresis in the force-velocity curve.

In this paper a method to suppress produced vortexes in two dimension channel that a fixed square cylinder placed in the middle of it in ReD 200 in order to find a way to suppress vortexes are investigated. At first different length of splitter plates attached to square obstruction are studied to obtain the effects of length on flow pattern. Subsequently simulations have been conducted in three dimension to validate previous results as well as acquire better understanding about the selected approach. Simulations have done by Lagrangian Eulerian method, plates first assummed fix with length 1.5mm, 4mm and 7.5mm, and then flexible plates with the same length are studied. Young's modulus for flexible plate and blockage ratio were constant values of 2×106 and 0.25 in all simulations, respectively.

This is due to their different pull-out mechanism and a larger number of individual fibres per kilo compared to steel fibres. Macro synthetic fibres bond to the concrete along their full length, usually with an embossed surface, while steel fibres are mostly anchored by their hooked ends. If the bond is defined by the length of the embossed surface, logically the longer the synthetic fibre the higher post-crack capacity. In this paper the same type of macro synthetic fibre was researched with different lengths but at the same dosage. The consistency of the fresh concrete together with the quality of the distribution of the fibres have been analysed and compared with the residual strength. After analysing these data the optimum fibre length was able to be determined. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'A discussion on the residual behaviour of Fibre Reinforced Concrete (FRC) is performed based on two selected cases of concrete degradation: the exposure at High Temperatures and the development of Alkali Silica Reactions. In addition, and taking in mind that the failure mechanism in FRC is strongly related with the fibre pull-out strength, the bond strength in damaged matrices was shown concluding that the residual bond strength is less affected than the matrix strength. As the damage increases, the compressive strength and the modulus of elasticity decrease, being the modulus of elasticity the most affected. There were no significant changes produced by the incorporation of fibres on the residual behaviour when compared with previous experience on plain damage concrete. Regarding the tensile behaviour although the first peak decreases as the damage increases, even for a severely damage FRC the residual stresses remain almost unaffected. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'This paper presents the results of a study examining the effect of steel fibres on the blast behaviour of high-strength concrete beams. As part of the study, a series of three large-scale beams built with high-strength concrete and steel fibres are tested under simulated blast loading using the shock-tube testing facility at the University of Ottawa. The specimens include two beams built with conventional high-strength concrete (HSC) and one beam built with high-strength concrete and steel fibres (HSFRC). The effect of steel fibres on the blast behaviour is examined by comparing the failure mode, mid-span displacements and, overall blast resistance of the specimens. The results show that the addition of steel fibres in high-strength concrete beams can prevent shear failure and substitute for shear reinforcement if added in sufficient quantity. Moreover, the use of steel fibres improves flexural response under blast loading by reducing displacements and increasing blast capacity. Finally, the provision of steel fibres is found to improve the fragmentation resistance of high-strength concrete under blast loads. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The paper presents an analysis of cracking localization in beams made of fibre-reinforced concrete with conventional reinforcement. This phenomenon has been quantified by the ratio m/n between the number of the significantly wide cracks and the total number of flexural cracks that developed within the constant moment zone of the beams. It is shown that beams with larger reinforcement ratio had larger values of m/n, that is, lower cracking localization. For the given concrete mix, when the reinforcement ratios ρ were larger than ∼2% cracking localization was diminished. Furthermore, for low values of ρ, m/n ratios of the specimens with lower fibre contents are somewhat larger than those of the specimens with larger content. It is also shown that as the reinforcement ratio decreases below ∼0.5% the normalized mid-span ultimate deflections decreases as well, which corresponds with the observation of the cracking localization phenomenon for low reinforcement ratios. For larger reinforcement ratio, when m/n increases above ∼0.6, there is no effect of cracking localization on the ultimate deflection. Moreover, in this range of r the values of d are 1.0, as commonly expected for RFC structural elements. It is noted that the ultimate deflection of the beams corresponds to their flexural ductility. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The aim of the present work is to assess whether a single fibre pull-out test can be related to the behaviour of multiple fibres in fibre reinforced concrete under bending condition.

The uniformly distributed steel or macro synthetic fibres in the concrete structures can give the concrete a residual flexural strength after the first cracks. The different behaviour of materials subjected to different loading rates is a well-known phenomenon, both with steel, synthetic and concrete materials. Standards usually present a recommendation for the loading speed in for different tests. Concrete elements show higher performance due to the high speed of loading or impact loads, their fracture energy and therefore their overall capacity appears greater than the specimens loaded at standard speeds. Fibre reinforced concrete structures are widely used in tramlines and railways, where the speed of the loading is high and therefore of impact by nature. It is important to know what the effect of this high speed loading is for fibre reinforced concrete structures: do these structures have additional capacity, or has the designer overestimated their performance? This article will present an investigation into the effect of the loading rate on case of using fibres with different materials in concrete beams. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'This paper examines the influence of steel fibres on the blast performance of normal-strength concrete and high-strength concrete columns.

Such residual load-bearing capacity of fibre reinforced concrete is assessed by flexural tensile tests in which the presence of fibres can bridge the crack formed and provide strengths that are directly related with the number of fibres and their positioning in the fracture surface. Therefore, the orientation and distribution of the fibres is decisive in the mechanical behaviour of fibre-reinforced concrete and this can be estimated by means of the orientation factor. Several classical models have been extensively used for the case of rigid steel fibres. The increasing interest in structural synthetic fibres that can bend demands new considerations in this matter. A probabilistic model that considers the previous research with stereographical assumptions has been performed allowing the use of fibres that can bend. This study has developed significant tools for design with the aim of predicting such number of fibres crossing a vertical surface using fibre reinforced concrete with steel and polyolefin fibres.

The test parameters covered fibres with different multi-hook ends, concrete compressive strength, reinforcing index and slab thickness. The statistical performance of two existing models for the prediction of punching shear capacity of SFRC slabs without traditional reinforcement was examined. The load carrying capacity of these slabs were also assessed using the yield line theory. It is noted that the slabs failed primarily in flexure and the yield line theory predicted the load carrying capacities of the slabs most accurately. The reason for a flexural failure in SFRC slabs without steel bars is attributed to the lesser energy required in the propagation of an existing flexural cracks than in the creation of a new circumferential cracks around the column face. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"An experimental investigation was carried out to assess the mechanical properties of reactive powder concrete (RPC) reinforced with steel fibres (2% in vol.) when exposed to high temperatures.

The mechanical properties of the RPC were assessed for specimens dried for 24 hours at 60 °C and 100 °C. Partially dried specimens (60 °C) exhibited explosive spalling at nearby 450 °C, while fully dried RPC specimens (100 °C) maintained their integrity after heating exposure. In general, the mechanical properties of RPC significantly decreased with the increase of the temperature exposure.

Concrete design codes ensure ductile behaviour of columns by setting a requirement for a minimum amount of transverse steel reinforcement. Therefore, the inclusion of discrete short fibres into the concrete mixture combined with a reduced amount of lateral reinforcement can be an alternative to the latter full amount required by the codes. This paper presents tests that were performed on large-scale fibre-reinforced NSC circular columns under cyclic flexure and constant axial load simulating earthquake loading.

By mixing polypropylene (PP) and CBA, a hybrid CBA filament was manufactured the diameter of the filament ranged between 1.60 mm and 1.75 mm. A porous polymer structure was manufactured based on the traditional fused deposition modelling (FDM) method. The process parameters of the three-dimensional (3D) porous polymer printing (PPP) process included nozzle temperature, printing speed, and CBA density. Porosity increase with an increase in nozzle temperature and CBA density. On the contrary, porosity increase with a decrease in the printing speed. For porous structures, it has excellent mechanical properties. We manufactured a simple shape in 3D using 3D PPP technology. In the future, we will study the excellent mechanical properties of 3D PPP technology and apply them to various safety fields. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Wüstite (W1 and W2) micropellets (150-50 μm) were prepared from the reduction of pure Fe2O3 and 2.1% SiO2-doped Fe2O3 in 40%CO/CO2 gas mixture at 1000°C which were then isothermally reduced in H2, CO and H2/CO gas mixtures at 900-1100°C. The reduction reactions was followed by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TG) technique. The effect of gas composition, gas pressure and temperature on the rate of reduction was investigated. The different phases formed during the reduction were chemically and physically characterized. In SiO2-doped wüstite, fayalite (Fe2SiO3) was identified. At the initial reduction stages, the highest rate was obtained in H2 and the lowest was in CO gas. In H2/CO gas mixtures, the measured rate did not follow a simple additive equation. The addition of 5% H2 to CO led to a measurable increase in the rate of reduction compared with that in pure CO. Incubation periods were observed at the early reduction stages of W1 in CO at lower gas pressure (&lt0.25 atm). In SiO2-doped wüstite, reaction rate minimum was detected in H2 and H2-rich gas mixtures at 925-950°C. The influence of addition of H2 to CO or CO to H2 on the reduction reactions, nucleation and grain growth of iron was intensively studied. Unlike in pure wüstite, the presence of fayalite enhances the reduction reactions with CO and CO-rich gas mixtures. The chemical reaction equations of pure wüstite with CO are given showing the formation of carbonyl-like compound [Fem(CO2)n]∗. The apparent activation energy values, at the initial stages, ranged from 53.75 to 133.97 kJ/mole indicating different reaction mechanism although the reduction was designed to proceed by the interfacial chemical reaction. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'For performance optimization of Refrigerated Warehouses, design parameters are selected based on the physical parameters such as number of equipment and aisles, speeds of forklift for ease of modification.

In response, it has become a national aspiration to incorporate a performance related fatigue test into the binder specifications for South Africa. The Binder Yield Energy Test (BYET) was the first in a series of tests analysed for its potential to predict the fatigue performance of the binder. The test is performed with the dynamic shear rheometer, giving two key parameters, namely, yield energy and shear strain at maximum shear stress (γτmax). The objective of the investigation was to perform a rudimentary evaluation of the BYET followed by a more in-depth investigation should the initial BYET results prove promising. The paper discusses the results generated from the BYET under eight different conditions, using six different binders. The results are then correlated with four point bending beam fatigue test results obtained from asphalt mix samples that were manufactured from the same binders. Final results indicate that the BYET is not ideal as an indicator of fatigue performance. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Secondary effects of intersections insufficient capacity in urban areas are negative impacts on environment out of acceleration and deceleration of vehicles moving in long queues. The positive influence of increased intersection performance to reduce delays and queues, as well as negative impacts on the atmosphere is presented in this paper. The case study includes two single-lane roundabouts located close to each other in Žilina. Both roundabouts do not comply with the current traffic loads. This results in long queues and delays lasting not just during the peak hours. The solution to this problem is a new type of roundabout - turbo-roundabout. Capacity characteristics of both the current and new state are determined by microsimulation using PTV Vissim software. Obtained main characteristics of traffic flows are used as inputs to establish emission productions of NOx, CO and HC at the roundabout entries. The paper shows that proposed basic turbo-roundabout provides significant higher capacity performance compared with current state. Waiting times and queue lengths decrease about ten times. Due to this reduction, emission productions decrease about 50-60%. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'A considerable part of the maintenance costs of tunnel structures is related to the inspection, maintenance and repair of the drainage system. The drainage system of tunnels is frequently clogged with Calcium precipitates. Cleaning and water conditioning are costintensive for operating companies. Apart from the direct costs associated with inspection, maintenance and repair works of the drainage system indirect costs are generated, such as by the blocking of the tunnel while inspection, maintenance or repair or by the reduction of the permitted operation speed. Sintering and clogging of the drainage systems is mainly caused by dissolution of cement minerals in concrete and mortar and/or by inadequate design and construction of the drainage system and/or grubby workmanship. With long-term studies and in-situ experiments in Austria traffic tunnels the specific input factors for sinter mechanism have been identified and appropriate counter measures could be defined. In particular modified mix designs for shotcretes and mortars have proven to bring a significant beneficial effect. By means of constructional measures and by the application of hardness stabilizers a further reduction of hard deposits inside the drainage system is achievable. The paper will deal with the specific aspects and will propose adequate counter measures. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"Rail vehicles in interaction with a railway structure induce vibrations that are propagating to surrounding structures and cause noise disturbance in the surrounding areas. Since tram tracks in urban areas often share the running surface with road vehicles one of top priorities is to achieve low maintenance and long lasting structure. Research conducted in scope of this paper gives an overview of newly designed tram track structures designated for use on Zagreb tram network and their performance in terms of noise and vibration mitigation. Research has been conducted on a 150 m long test section consisted of three tram track types: standard tram track structure commonly used on tram lines in Zagreb, optimized tram structure for better noise and vibration mitigation and a slab track with double sleepers embedded in a concrete slab, which presents an entirely new approach of tram track construction in Zagreb. Track has been instrumented with acceleration sensors, strain gauges and revision shafts for inspection. Relative deformations give an insight into track structure dynamic load distribution through the exploitation period.

However, it is not yet fully understood which bitumen properties have a significant influence on the behaviour of bituminous mixtures. In this context, the FunDBitS project was developed. Its main objective was to prepare recommendations on the properties of the bitumen to be specified in order to obtain suitable bituminous mixtures, namely in what concerns to its resistance to permanent deformation (rutting), stiffness, low temperature cracking, fatigue cracking and binder/aggregate interaction. In this framework, the research studies that have become internationally available since the BiTVal project were reviewed in order to assess performance-based bitumen characteristics, which may be introduced into bitumen specification standards. This paper specifically presents the main conclusions regarding the properties of bitumen related to the behaviour to permanent deformation of bituminous mixtures. It was concluded that the most promising test is the \"non-recoverable creep compliance\" (Jnr) from the Multiple Stress Creep and Recovery (MSCR) test method, although Zero/Low Shear Viscosity (ZSV/LSV) by creep or oscillation test method can also give good correlations with permanent deformation of bituminous mixtures. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'The mechanical performance of an asphalt pavement affects its durability - thus carbon footprint. Many parameters contribute to the success of a durable asphalt mix, e.g. material selection, an accurate mix and even the road design in which the asphalt mix quality is quantified. The quality of the asphalt mix, by its mechanical properties, is also related to the compaction degree. However, and specifically for high volume rates, the laying process at the construction site needs an effective method to monitor and adjust immediately the compaction quality before cooling and without damaging the layer, which is now absent. In this paper the use of a non-nuclear density gauge (PQI - Pavement Quality Indicator) is evaluated, based on a site at Brussels Airport. Considering the outcome of the present research, this PQI is advised as a unique tool for continuous density measurements and allow immediate adjustments during compaction, and decreases the number of core drilling for quality control, and as a posteriori asphalt pavement density test where cores are prohibited.

Storability is assessed indirectly using various tests of workability. Therefore, simple test methods (self-compaction and disintegration test) was developed and verified to investigate changes of storability of this group of cold asphalts. Selfcompaction of the tested mixture in the upturned Abram's cone for the cement concrete slump test and in the mould for the California Bearing Ratio test was assessed in first stage. After that the video record of disintegration test was taken. During this test, the mould was lifted up and the mixture fell off the mould (Abram's cone) or disintegrate (CBR mould). The drop of surface after 10 min self-compaction and netto time related to falling out or disintegration of the mixture were used to evaluate the mixture from storability point of view. It was found out the self-compaction test has not a potential to reveal and prove changes of mixture properties. Based on the disintegration test results it can be stated this test at 5 °C using the upturned Abram's cone could be a suitable approach to determine qualitative changes of a cold mixture from storability point of view. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.\",\n"," \"The proposed study describes applying of neural network and fuzzy logic in transport control for safety improvement by evaluation of accidents' risk by intelligent infrastructure devices.

Especially in wintertime, it is highly likely that the causes are adhered snow or ice deposits, which are falling off the vehicle. Due to the high kinetic energy, the impact can lead to the removal of ballast stones from the structure of the ballasted track. If the stones reach the height of vehicles underside, they may be accelerated significantly due to the collision with the vehicle or may detach further ice blocks. In the worst case, a reinforcing effect occurs, which can lead to considerable damage to railway vehicles (under-floor-area, vehicle exteriors, etc.) and infrastructure (signal masts, noise barriers, etc.). Additionally the flying gravel is a significant danger to people in the nearby area of the tracks. With this feasibility study the applicability and meaningfulness of an intelligent monitoring system for identification of the critical ice accumulation to prevent the ballast fly induced by ice dropping was examined. The key findings of the research are that the detection of ice on railway vehicles and the development of an intelligent monitoring seem to be possible with existing technologies, but a proof of concept in terms of field tests is necessary. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'A considerable funds is spent for the roads maintenance in large areas during the winter.

For complex systems, such as railway and road infrastructures, the cost of maintenance plays an important role in the LCC analysis. Costs associated with maintenance interventions can be more reliably estimated by integrating the probabilistic nature of the failures associated to these interventions in the LCC models. Reliability, Maintainability, Availability and Safety (RAMS) parameters describe the maintenance needs of an asset in a quantitative way by using probabilistic information extracted from registered maintenance activities. Therefore, the integration of RAMS in the LCC analysis allows obtaining reliable predictions of system maintenance costs and the dependencies of these costs with specific cost drivers through sensitivity analyses. This paper presents an innovative approach for a combined RAMS & LCC methodology for railway and road transport infrastructures being developed under the on-going H2020 project INFRALERT.

The E136 is one of the most important transportation routes in the county of Møre and Romsdal and starts in Ålesund, and passes along Tresfjorden to Åndalsnes. The existing road is very narrow with speed limit of 60 km/h and characterizes by many accidents involving cars and people. The traffic flow is approximately ca 2500 vehicles a day, of this is 25% heavy vehicles. Those transport fresh salmon from the breeders in the fjords along the coast. To try to decrease the transportation time is very important for the fresh salmon. The bridge reduces the distance between Ålesund and Åndalsnes by 13 km. The speed limit is now 80 km/h, and with much less risk for accidents since there are separate lanes for cars and pedestrians over the whole bridge.

This reduces both durability and increases costs. This has been addressed by development in NZ of a performance specification for hot mix asphalt binders (including modified) and work being done on sealing grades. This paper discusses the development of the HMA specification with respect to crude sources and the development of methodologies to assess imported binders for suitability in all applications including emulsion. The conclusion is that bitumen quality may be maintained by use of these methodologies that include, chromatographic analysis, measurement of thermodynamic internal stability (Heithaus), aging, and Dynamic Shear Rheometry testing and mix performance testing in the laboratory.

The use of thermosetting polymers including epoxy resins for asphalt and bitumen modification is seen as a perspective solution for this issue. Conducted at DerzhdorNDI SE studies have proved high riding qualities of asphalt pavements that contain epoxy resins. When replacing 20-35% of bitumen with epoxy component, a significant improvement in strength characteristics of asphalt pavement is noted, especially at elevated temperatures. Specific feature of epoxy asphalt concrete is its ability to gain strength over a long-term operation.

During these flight conditions the free-stream approaching the wings undergo fundamental changes. In transonic flow conditions, typically in the military or aerospace applications, existence of nonlinear and unsteady effects of the airflow stream significantly alters the performance of an airfoil. This paper presents the influence of free-stream turbulence intensity on transonic flow over an airfoil in the presence of a weak shock wave. In particular, NACA 0012 airfoil performance at Ma∞ = 0.7 is considered in terms of drag, lift, turbulence kinetic energy, and turbulence eddy dissipation parameters under the influence of varying angle of attacks and free-stream turbulence. The finite volume method in a commercial CFD package ANSYS-CFX is used to perform the numerical analysis of the flow. Mesh refinement using a mesh-adaption technique based on velocity gradient is presented for more accurate prediction of shocks and boundary layers. A Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model is validated against experimental data available in the literature. Numerical simulations were performed, with free stream turbulence intensity ranging from low (1%), medium (5%) to high (10%) levels. Results revealed that drag and lift coefficients are approximately the same at every aforementioned value of turbulence intensity. However, turbulence kinetic energy and eddy dissipation contours vary as turbulence intensity changes, but their changes are disproportionally small, compared with values adopted for free-stream turbulence. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'Gears are the most important transmission component in machines.

In this study, it is suggested one is able to achieve the reactionless condition through combining the self-balanced system. For example, the dynamic balancing condition can be realized via the reconfiguration concept. Extra counter-mass is not employed but through reconfiguring the whole structure, in this way, the system will not get to be heavy and therefore, reduce the energy costs and make the system more applicable and flexible for space applications. Based on this concept, first and foremost, one needs to balance a single component through the reconfiguration approach (i.e. decomposition process) and after that integrate the above balanced components to build the entire system (i.e. integration process). Finally, with the mechanical reconfiguration, the control laws governing the operation of the mechanism also need to be changed, so as to make whole systems more flexible when they are used in space. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'This paper studies the structural stresses of differential drive (DD) and harmonic drive (HD) for design improvement of reducers.

Especially, the suction valve, which is opened nearly during the whole suction stroke, has a big potential for improvement. Usually, suction valves are opened only by vacuum created by the moving piston and should be closed before the compression stroke starts to avoid a reversed mass-flow through the valve. Therefore, the valves are prestressed, which results on the other hand in a higher flow resistance. In this work, a suction valve is investigated, which is not closed by the preload of the valve but by an electromagnetic coil located in the suction muffler neck. Shortly before the piston reaches its bottom dead centre, voltage is applied to the coil and a magnetic force is generated which pulls the valve shut. Thereby, the flow resistance through the valve can be reduced by changing the preload on the reed valve because it is no longer needed to close the valve. The investigation of this adapted valve and the electromagnetic coil is firstly done by numerical simulations including fluid structure interactions of the reed valves of a reciprocating compressor and secondly by experiments made on a calorimeter test bench. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," \"Suction and discharge processes with self actuated valves have a major influence in efficiency and reliability of hermetic reciprocating compressors.

In the conventional CFD analysis of the linear compressor, the load condition was not considered in the behaviour of the piston. In some papers, behaviour of piston is assumed as sinusoidal motion provided by user defined function (UDF). In the reciprocating type compressor, the stroke of the piston is restrained by the rod, while the stroke of the linear compressor is not restrained, and the stroke changes depending on the load condition. The greater the pressure difference between the discharge refrigerant and the suction refrigerant, the more the centre point of the stroke is pushed backward. And the behaviour of the piston is not a complete sine wave. For this reason, when the load condition changes in the CFD analysis of the linear compressor, it may happen that the ANSYS code is changed or unfortunately the modelling is changed. In addition, a separate analysis or calculation is required to find a stroke that meets the load condition, which may contain errors. In this study, the coupled mechanical equations and electrical equations are solved using the UDF, and the behaviour of the piston is solved considering the pressure difference across the piston. Using the above method, the stroke of the piston with respect to the motor specification of the analytical model can be calculated according to the input voltage, and the piston behaviour can be realized considering the thrust amount due to the pressure difference. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.',\n"," 'In addition to the reduction of friction the oil in a hermetic compressor is very important for the transfer of heat from hot parts to the compressor shell.

Not only does it lower the mass flow rate provided by the compressor, reducing its volumetric efficiency, but also gives rise to outflux of energy that decreases the isentropic efficiency. Leakage in the piston-cylinder clearance of reciprocating compressors is driven by the piston motion and pressure difference between the compression chamber and the shell internal environment. In compressors adopted for domestic refrigeration, such a clearance is usually filled by a mixture of refrigerant and lubricating oil. Besides its lubricating function, the oil also acts as sealing element for the piston-cylinder clearance, and hence leakage is expected to be more detrimental to oil-free compressors. This paper presents a model based on the Reynolds equation for compressible fluid flow to predict leakage in oil-free reciprocating compressors. The model is solved throughout the compression cycle so as to assess the effect of the clearance geometry and piston velocity on leakage and compressor efficiency.

concentration (c0) on the xylose separation from glucose. the filtration experiments were carried out in total reflux mode with different feed concentration of 2, 5, and 10 g/l at different tmp of 5,8 and 10 bar. the performances of the nf membrane were evaluated by measuring the permeate flux and sugar rejection for each experiment. all the samples were quantified using a high performance liquid

anti-helminthic. the main objectives of this research were to determine bioactive compounds in agarwood leaves leaves extract and oil yield obtained from maceration and soxhlet extraction methods respectively. the maceration process was performed at different operating temperature of 25°c, 50°c and 75°c and different retention time at 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes. meanwhile, various solvents were used to extract the oil from agarwood leaves using soxhlet method which are hexane, water, isopropanol and ethanol. the extracted oil from agarwood leaves by soxhlet extraction was analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry. the results showed that the highest extract of 1.53% was obtained when increase the temperature to 75 °c and longest retention time of 120 minutes gave the highest oil yield of 2.10 % by using maceration. this is because at higher temperature enhances the solubility solute and diffusivity coefficient, thus increase the extract yield while longer retention time allow the reaction between solvent and solute occurred more rapidly giving higher extract. furthermore, the soxhlet extraction using n-hexane as the solvent gave the highest oil yield as compared to other solvent due to the non-polar properties of n-hexane increase the efficiency of oil which is also non-polar to soluble in the solvent. in addition, the results also reported that the oil extracted from agarwood leaves contains bioactive compounds which are phytol, squalene, n-hexadecanoic acid and octadecatrienoic acid. therefore, oil extracted from agarwood leaves has the

unconfined compressive strength (ucs) of the untreated and treated marine clays, compacted at the optimum moisture content was later obtained. the treated marine clay was tested at 0, 3 and 7 days curing periods. the results show that the plasticity index of bs-rc treated marine clay was lower than the untreated marine clay. from the ucs test results, it is shown that bs-rc mixtures had significantly improved the strength of marine clay. with the same percentage of 9% bs-rc, the increased of bs from 7% to 8% increased the ucs further to about six times more than untreated marine clay

decouple the effect of shear and elongation stress due to gravity stretched drawing. the morphology of the spun hollow fiber was observed under scanning electron microscope (sem) and the overall porosity were measured using mercury intrusion porosimeter. shear rate and apparent viscosity at the tip of the spinneret annulus were simulated using a computational fluid dynamics package solidworks floworks. simulation data shows that extrusion rate increment increases the shear rate at the spinneret wall which in turn reduce the apparent viscosity consistent with a non newtonian shear thinning fluid behavior. thus, the outer finger-like region grows as the shear rate increases. also, overall porosity of hollow fiber membrane decreases with extrusion rate increment which is caused by better molecular orientation resulting in denser hollow fiber membrane. thin outer finger-like region is achieved at low shear experience of 109.55 s-1 via a straight spinneret. increasing the extrusion rate

to investigate variability in transcutaneous oxygen saturation (sto2) amongst different individuals and at different skin sites. noncontact reflectance data are collected from central forehead, posterior forearm, thenar region of palm and proximal ankle of three healthy asians. the prediction of the required sto2 value is via fitting extended modified lambert (emlb) model to the measured attenuation data using extinction coefficient of hemoglobin components in the wavelength range of 520 - 600 nm as its priori knowledge. the obtained results revealed a relatively high mean sto2 of 54 ± 1.9% at the palm of the hand site. this is followed by measurement at foot ankle and forehead with sto2 of 52.3 ± 2.4% and 51.2 ± 7.7%, respectively. meanwhile the lowest reading of sto2 of 48.8 ±

vehicle body structure load paths. the application of this simplified approach is highly beneficial in the design development of modern passenger car structure especially during the conceptual stage. in malaysia, however, there is no real physical model of sss available to gain considerable insight and understanding into the function of each major subassembly in the whole vehicle structures. based on this motivation, a physical model of sss for sedan model with the corresponding model vehicle tests of bending and torsion is proposed in this work. the proposed approach is relatively easy to understand as compared to finite element method (fem). the results show that the proposed vehicle model test is capable to show that satisfactory load paths can give a sufficient structural stiffness within the vehicle structure. it is clearly observed that the global bending stiffness reduce significantly when more panels are removed from a complete sss model. it is identified that parcel shelf is an important subassembly to sustain bending load. the results also match with the theoretical hypothesis, as the stiffness of the structure in an open section condition is shown weak when subjected to torsion load compared to bending load. the proposed approach can potentially be integrated with fem to speed up the design process of automotive vehicle. © published under licence by iop publishing

slope, and soil geological profile. the mechanism of the failures is mainly due to the loss of matric suction of soils by rainwater. when rainwater infiltrates into the slopes, it will start to saturate the soil, i.e., reduce the matric suction. a good understanding of landslide mechanisms and the characteristics of unsaturated soil and rock in tropical areas is crucial in landslide hazard formulation. most of the slope failures in unsaturated tropical residual soil in malaysia are mainly due to infiltration, especially during intense and prolonged rainfall, which reduces the soil matric suction and hence decreases the stability of the slope. therefore, the aim of this research is to determine the matric suction for barren soil and to model an unsaturated slope with natural rainfall to evaluate the effects of matric suction on rainfall intensity. a field test was carried out using the watermark soil moisture sensor to determine the matric suction. the sensor was connected to a program called specware 9 basic which also used data logging rain gauge watermark 1120 to measure the intensity and duration of rainfall. this study was conducted at the research centre for soft soil which is a new research and development (r & d) initiative by universiti tun hussein onn malaysia, parit raja. field observation showed that the highest daily suction was recorded during noon while the lowest suction was obtained at night and early morning. the highest matric suction for loose condition was 31.0 kpa while the highest matric suction for compacted condition was 32.4 kpa. the results implied that the field suction variation was not only governed by the rainfall, but also the cyclic evaporation process. the findings clearly indicated that the changes in soil suction distribution patterns occurred due to different weather conditions. © published under licence by iop publishing ltd.',\n"," 'the determination and identification of slope instability are often

potential materials to be used with thermoplastic as a composite due to its attractive properties such as lightweight and strong. in this paper, flammability properties of this material are evaluated through underwriters laboratory 94 horizontal burning (ul94 hb), which has been conducted for both controlled and uncontrolled conditions, smoke density and limiting oxygen index tests (loi). these flammability tests are in compliance with the federal aviation regulation (far) requirement. the results from ul94 hb and smoke density tests show that the presence of nanoclays with effective composition of kenaf fiber reinforced abs has enhanced the burning characteristics of the material by hindering propagation of flame spread over the surface of the material through char formation. consequently, this decreases the burning rate and produces low amount of smoke during burning. on contrary, through loi test, this material requires less oxygen to burn when exposed to fire, which hinders the enhancement of burning characteristics. this is due to burning mechanism exhibited by nanoclays that catalyzes barrier formation and flame propagation rate over the surface of the biocomposite material. overall, these experimental results suggest that this biocomposite material is capable of self-extinguishing and possesses effective fire extinction. the observed novel synergism from the result obtained is promising to be implemented in secondary structures of aircraft with significant benefits such as cost-effective, lightweight and biodegradable self-extinguishing

order to understand the performance of a rainwater harvesting system (rwh), a preliminary monitoring on a 'do it yourself' (diy) rwh model with additional first -flush strategy for water quality treatment was done. the main concept behind first flush diversion is to prevent initial polluted rainwater from entering the storage tank. based on seven rainfall events observed in parit raja, both quality and quantity of the rainfalls were analysed. for rainwater quality, the samples from first flush diverter and storage tank were taken to understand their performance based on ph, dissolved oxygen (do), turbidity, total dissolved solid (tds), total suspended solid (tss), chemical oxygen demand (cod) and biochemical oxygen demand (bod) parameters. while for rainwater quantity, hydrograph analysis were done based on the performance of total rainfall and runoff, peak flow of rainfall and runoff and delayed time parameters. based on interim national water quality standard (inwqs) and national drinking water quality standard (ndwqs), first flush diverter apparently helps on water quality improvement in storage tanks when ph, do, tds, tss and turbidity were classified as class i (inwqs) and is allowable for drinking but bod and cod parameters were classified as class iii (inwqs). hence, it has potential to be used as potable usage but will need extensive treatment to reduce

water jet machining performance. design, materials, and life of the nozzle give significance effect to the nozzle wear. there are various parameters that may influence the wear rate of the nozzle such as nozzle length, nozzle inlet angle, nozzle diameter, orifice diameter, abrasive flow rate and water pressure. the wear rate of the nozzle can be minimized by controlling these parameters. the mechanism of wear in the nozzle is similar to other traditional machining processes which uses a cutting tool. the high pressure of the water and hard abrasive particles may erode the nozzle wall. a

the crack propagation resistance is found higher in hybrid mmc than that of mmc with al2o3 whisker and the al alloy in the low δk region. the crack propagation in the hybrid mmc in the near-threshold region is directed by the debonding of reinforcement-matrix followed by void nucleation in the al alloy matrix. besides, the crack propagation in the stable- or midcrack-growth region is controlled by the debonding of particle-matrix and whisker-matrix interface caused by the cycle-by-cycle crack growth along the interface. the transgranular fracture of the reinforcement and void formation are also

dynamic demand and stochastic processing time. as a consequence, the solutions obtained from the traditional scheduling technique are ineffective wherever changes occur to the system. therefore, this research intends to develop a decision support tool (dst) based on promising artificial intelligent that is able to accommodate the dynamics that regularly occur in job shop scheduling problem. the dst was designed through three phases, i.e. (i) the look-up table generation, (ii) inverse model development and (iii) integration of dst components. this paper reports the generation of look-up tables for various scenarios as a part in development of the dst. a discrete event simulation model was used to compare the performance among spt, edd, fcfs, s/opn and slack rules the best performances measures (mean flow time, mean tardiness and mean lateness) and the job order requirement (inter-arrival time, due dates tightness and setup time ratio) which were compiled into look-up tables. the well-known 6/6/j/cmax problem from muth and thompson (1963) was used as a case study. in the future, the performance measure of various scheduling scenarios and the job order requirement

demand especially in automobile industries. aluminium alloy as a matter of fact has a low melting point and high ductility that severely adhere to the cutting tool surface and cause deterioration of chip evacuation. this problem often resulting in tools breakage. in this paper, in order to impart functions of anti-adhesion, we propose a technique by controlling the grinding marks micro texture on the tool surface by using the blast polishing treatment without any coating technologies. the results show that the tool which underwent polishing treatment reduces the cutting force as well as the aluminium adherence during the initial cutting process, and become worst as the process cutting continues. these results indicate that grinding mark texture improves the anti-adhesion by reducing the contact area during cutting and provide storage for the lubricant. in addition, too much polishing on the tool surface may remove these textures and resultantly worsen the tool performance. ©

relative humidity 70%. the obtained results reveal that friction coefficient of ptfe increases with the increase in normal loads and sliding velocities within the observed range. on the other hand, frictional values of nylon decrease with the increase in normal loads and sliding velocities. it is observed that in general, these polymers show higher frictional values when sliding against ss 316 rather than mild steel. during running-in process, friction coefficient of ptfe and nylon steadily increases with the increase in rubbing time and after certain duration of rubbing, it remains at steady level. at identical operating conditions, the frictional values are significantly different depending on normal load, sliding velocity and material pair. it is also observed that in general,

activities of the p25 and the p90 were higher than the n100 and the uv100 for the removal of both 2,4-d and 2,4,5-t. the high activities of the p25 and the p90 could be attributed to their phase compositions, which are made up of a mixture of anatase and rutile phases of tio2. whereas, the uv100 and the n100 are made up of 100% anatase phase of tio2. the synergistic effect of the

led to a higher activity of tio2 for removal of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-d) herbicide. a series of cuo/tio2 with cuo loadings of 0.1-1 wt% was prepared through a co-precipitation method. x-ray diffraction patterns revealed that the presence of cuo could not be detected as the low loading amount of cuo might have good dispersion on the surface of tio2. diffuse reflectance uv-visible spectra suggested that low loading amount of cuo did not influence the optical property of tio2. fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that tio2 possessed a dominant emission peak of 407 nm at an excitation wavelength of 218 nm. the increasing loading amount of cuo decreased the emission intensity of tio2, suggesting the successful reduction of charge recombination. after irradiation under uv light for 1 h, cuo(0.1 wt%)/tio2 gave the highest percentage removal of the herbicide among the samples. the optimum loading amount of cuomight improve the charge separation and reduce the electron-hole recombination on tio2 without blocking the active sites, thus leading to the improved photocatalytic activity. this work showed that cuo/tio2 is a potential photocatalyst for

technology are mainly limited to energy storage for power plants using large scale underground caverns. this paper explores the possibility of making use of reinforced concrete pile foundations to store renewable energy generated from solar panels or windmills attached to building structures. the energy will be stored inside the pile foundation with hollow sections via compressed air. given the relatively small volume of storage provided by the foundation, the required storage pressure is expected to be higher than that in the large-scale underground cavern. the high air pressure typically associated with large temperature increase, combined with structural loads, will make the pile foundation in a complicated loading condition, which might cause issues in the structural and geotechnical safety. this paper presents a preliminary analytical study on the performance of the pile foundation subjected to high pressure, large temperature increase and structural loads. finite element analyses on pile foundation models, which are built from selected prototype structures, have been conducted. the analytical study identifies maximum stresses in the concrete of the pile foundation under combined pressure, temperature change and structural loads. recommendations have been made for the use of reinforced concrete pile foundations for renewable energy storage. ©

of pre-cursor material low calcium fly ash (fa) and ground granulated blast furnace slag (ggbfs) were activated using different proportions of sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide solutions. the

generally the most used material in the field of construction. despite its extensive use in structures, it represents some drawbacks related to its properties including its low tensile strength and low ductility. to solve this problem, the use of steel reinforcement in concrete structures is possible. another possibility is the introduction of different types of continuous fibre / staple in the concrete, such as steel fibres or synthetic fibres, to obtain ″concretes bundles″. many types of fibre concrete, which have been developed and for many of them, the gain provided by the fibre was rather low and no significant improvement in tensile strength was really reaching. by cons, the ductility was higher than that of ordinary concrete. the objective of this study is to examine concrete

the recommended three layers of insulation paint. the three layers recommended by the manufacturer did not significantly affect the appearance of the brick facade. color and gloss were not significantly changed. experiments showed the absence of thermal insulation effect of nansulate transparent triple coating. the thermal insulation effect could likely be reached by more layers of application, which, on the other hand may be unacceptable on the heritage conservation because of number of applications, time demand and financial costs. the effects of multiple layers on heritage

with traditional procedures can be solved, detailed step by step in technical drawing and descriptive geometry manuals, cad applications allow us to do the same and generalize it later, incorporating references. traditional teachings have become obsolete and current curricula have been relegated. however, they can be applied in certain automation processes. the use of geometric references (using variables in script languages) and their incorporation into hlcts allows the automation of drawing processes. instead of repeatedly creating similar exercises or modifying data in the same exercises, users should be able to use hlcts to generate future modifications of these exercises. this paper introduces the automation process when generating exercises based on cad script files, aided by parametric geometry calculation tools. the proposed method allows us to design new exercises without user intervention. the integration of cad, mathematics, and descriptive geometry facilitates their

the national level is scarce, so it is yet unknown if these initiatives and regulations have had positive effects. in this article, we monitor the change in urban vegetation in 13 chilean cities located in a latitudinal gradient of practically zero to almost 1800 mm of annual rainfall. we calculated the trends in ndvi (2000-2016) as an indicator of change in urban greenery using data from the modis subsets platform. likewise, to assess whether the initiatives have had an effect we quantified the number of urban parks existing at the beginning of the period and how many were created during the study period. for this, we analysed official databases and high spatial resolution satellite images. armed with said data, we assessed whether these new parks had impacted the tendency toward change in urban greenery. the results indicate that, in general, chilean cities vary greatly inter-annually in urban greenery and have lost urban vegetation in the last 16 years, with significant losses in four of those cities. two cities located in desert ecosystems represent an exception and showed positive trends in their urban vegetation. the rainfall in cities has an impact on the amount of vegetation, but not on their tendency to change, i.e. there are cities with loss of vegetation at all levels of precipitation. the creation of parks has not been able to reverse negative trends, which indicates the prevalence of other drivers of change that are not sufficiently compensated by initiatives and regulations that seek to increase urban vegetation. today, planning and management of urban vegetation is a challenge for urban sustainability and must be addressed systematically, integrally and implemented via urban regulations. it is imperative to focus on cities in extenso, taking into consideration residential areas, private spaces, peri-urban areas, etc. likewise, climate in each city, inter-annual variability and future changes must also be considered when designing green

institutions are arising. two groups of the legislative documents influencing the implementation of the landscape policy in latvia are detected within the study. the first group is strategic documents determining main landscape planning principles and directions at european, national, regional and professional or sectoral level. the second group is operational documents providing a set of actions for the landscape planning, protection and management at the local or the municipality level. the study concludes that operational documents developed by the municipalities are in high importance because of their direct influence on the landscape planning in latvia. this often leads to the different landscape planning requirements included in the normative documents of the neighbouring municipalities, although the spatial and ecological borders of the visual landscape do not fit with the formal borders of the municipalities. thus, it is essential to develop the common principles and actions that would be incumbent on all municipalities to provide the landscape integrity and to protect its values according to the main principles defined in the european landscape convention. ©

pavement is a recognized sustainable solution for urban roads. to enhance mechanical properties of pervious concrete material, in order to allow wider use of this technology, a lot of studies are going on all over the world. the use of a little percentage of fine aggregates is proven to increase the material resistance without an excessive reduction of permeability. this study aimed to evaluate the effect of replacing the fine virgin aggregates with r cycled tire rubber. 14 different mixes were analysed in terms of indirect tensile strength resistance, void content and density. two different dimensions of crumb rubber were studied, as well as two different dosages, which were applied to different no-fine control mixes. all results were compared with the same control mixes containing natural fine aggregate. the mixes had a fixed granulometric curve but varied in water/cement ratio this in order to evaluate the effect of recycled rubber depending to w/c ratio of the mix. an image analysis was also conducted to verify the rubber distribution in the mixture and the cracking surfaces. the experimental analysis showed that a correct proportioning of fine sand significantly increased the strength of the material. moreover, the use of recycled waste tire rubber, gave interesting improvements respect to the no-fine control mixes, even though the developed resistance was lower respect to mixes containing mineral sand. this result was expected because of the cementing property of mineral sand. although, the important result was that it was possible to use waste tire rubber in pervious concrete, with an appropriate dosage and granular dimension, for increasing the performance of traditional mix design, in order to achieve pavement materials more and

adjusted. the method also takes into account other important characteristics of bottom material - the shape and orientation of the particles, settling velocity and drag coefficients. thus, the method is mainly meant for the natural sand-gravel material, which is heterogeneous and the particle shape of the bottom material is very different from spherical. the calculation of the river channel in the

components, there is a need of more detail research on hydrological conditions of the river basin, runoff of which creates the main source of water in the reservoir. over the lifetime of the water management systems the hydrological time series are never repeated in the same form which served as the input for the design of the system components. the design assumes the observed time series to be representative at the time of the system use. however, it is rather unrealistic assumption, because the hydrological past will not be exactly repeated over the design lifetime. when designing the water management systems, the specialists may occasionally face the insufficient or oversized capacity design, possibly wrong specification of the management rules which may lead to their non-optimal use. it is therefore necessary to establish a comprehensive approach to simulate the fluctuations in the interannual runoff (taking into account the current dry and wet periods) in the form of stochastic modelling techniques in water management practice. the paper deals with the methodological procedure of modelling the mean monthly flows using the stochastic thomas-fiering model, while modification of this model by wilson-hilferty transformation of independent random number has been applied. this transformation usually applies in the event of significant asymmetry in the observed time series. the methodological procedure was applied on the data acquired at the gauging station of horné orešany in the parná stream. observed mean monthly flows for the period of 1.11.1980 - 31.10.2012 served as the model input information. after extrapolation the model parameters and wilson-hilferty transformation parameters the synthetic time series of mean monthly flows were simulated. those have been compared with the observed hydrological time series using basic statistical characteristics (e. g. mean, standard deviation and skewness) for testing the quality of the model simulation. the synthetic hydrological series of monthly flows were created having the same statistical properties as the time series observed in the past. the compiled model was able to take into account the diversity of extreme hydrological situations in a form of synthetic series of mean monthly flows, while the occurrence of a set of flows was confirmed, which could and may occur in the future. the results of stochastic modelling in the form of synthetic time series of mean monthly flows, which takes into account the seasonal fluctuations of runoff within the year, could be applicable in engineering hydrology (e. g. for optimum use of the existing water management system that is related to reassessment of economic risks of the system). © published under licence by iop

related to high and low temperatures, which in turn implies higher maintenance costs and superior carbon footprints. to overcome this weaken, bitumen industry has been developing new polymer modifiers, additives to improve hma behaviour. one of the techniques most used in developed countries to enhance hma behaviour is the use of modified bitumen. modifying the bitumen, and then producing modified hma requires specific equipment and facilities that may be time-consuming, expensive and hard to manage. for instance, to warranty a successful modifying process, storage and handling of the modified bitumen are issues very complex to handle. on the other hand, producing a polymer modified hma by adding polymers and additives directly during the bitumen/aggregate mixing process may offer very interesting advantages since the economical, production and sustainability standpoint. this paper aimed to determine the feasibility of the incorporation of fibres and plastomeric polymers into different types of hma by means of the \"dry process\" (to add polymers during the mixing of aggregate and bitumen in the hma plant) to produce polymer modified mixes. thus, laboratory tests including marshall stability, indirect tensile stiffness modulus, repeated load test and indirect tensile strength test were performed to assess the effect of the inclusion of fibres and plastomeric polymers on mechanical and volumetric properties of selected mixes. results showed that the modification of bituminous mixtures following the \"dry process\" could be used to improve the performance and long term

field of building constructions. we can find such a structures as part of roofs or design facades. by using these lamellas like, non-bearing structures as a part of architectural design of buildings, it is necessary to consider wind effects on these structures. subtle structures of this type are prone to vibration in the transverse direction of the wind flow. the fact that the vibration occurs depends on wind parameters (wind velocity, direction of an air flow) and it also depends on the properties of lamella (shape, length, mass, natural frequency, support type). the principal idea of this article is to show susceptibility of lamellae-like structures to transverse resonant vibration caused by the phenomenon called von karman effect. comparison of susceptibility to transverse resonance vibration was analysed on the different shapes of lamellas loaded by different wind speed. analysis was based on usage of empirically derived equations. von karman effect arise from wind flow past an object. turbulence in the form of vortices are formed at the object and shed into the flowing stream intermittently. the potential problem is that this turbulence can induce vibrations into the lamella itself. in terms of this vibration problem, two frequencies are interesting. von karman shedding frequency is the frequency at which the vortices are formed and shed at the object. the vortex-shedding frequency increases with the velocity of the wind flow and decreases with the size of the object. natural frequency of the object depends on the construction of the lamella itself. parameters of lamella as a shape, mass, length, elasticity modulus of material and support types are directly involved in the calculation of natural frequency. worst case scenario in the term of transverse resonant vibration occurs when the natural frequency of lamella is equal to the vortex-shedding frequency. in this case vibration rises and structure can be snapped or deformed permanently. in the long term vibration, fatigue stress can be significant. at the conclusion hazardous wind speed and recommendations for different shapes and parameters of lamellas are shown. © published under

are preferred. research based on design serves as a tool for decision-making on further restoration approaches to a specific cultural heritage object. the selected romanesque palace of the spiš castle has passed through many structural periods. the interior doesn't exist and the perimeter walls create a raised landscape landmark. romanesque, gothic and renaissance periods were identifiable. it

transparent structure based on glass panels and translucent structures based on a textile membrane. we achieve a new space for new functional use of the palace by means of various ways of physical enclosing. on the other side, we work with alternatives of the perimeter wall perforation according to the historical periods. new inserted structures are designed in contemporary technologies and materials. an analysis of particular architectural proposals is the result. the shape, material selection (steel, timber), roof support structure selection and choice of transparent or translucent covering are subordinated to the architectural concept of the historical period's presentation including contemporaneousness. the solved problem was, how new interventions are able to visually coexist with historical original without diminishing its authenticity. glazed and membrane structures used for covering authentic ruins request professional architectural modelling of alternatives based on exact historical facts. the decision making process is made easier by visualizations. structural shapes issued from original tectonic rules (standard, order) appear from the point of visual and also monument restoration criteria more favourable than structural shapes, which were not inspired by these rules. plane shaped glazed roof shapes from this point of view seem to be more intrinsic than rounded. on the other side, alternatives with use of textile membranes have soft shape morphology, which is beneficial for new and also historic shapes of roofing in this researched example. ©

size fraction distribution determination. following the technical advancement, optical methods such as laser diffraction can be also used nowadays for grain size distribution determination in the soil. according to the literature review of domestic as well as international sources related to this topic, it is obvious that the results obtained by laser diffractometry do not correspond with the results obtained by pipette method. the main aim of this paper was to analyse 132 samples of medium fine soil, taken from the nitra river catchment in slovakia, from depths of 15-20 cm and 40-45 cm, respectively, using laser analysers: analysette 22 microtec plus (fritsch gmbh) and mastersizer 2000 (malvern instruments ltd). the results obtained by laser diffractometry were compared with pipette method and the regression relationships using linear, exponential, power and polynomial trend were derived. regressions with the three highest regression coefficients (r2) were further investigated. the fit with the highest tightness was observed for the polynomial regression. in view of the results obtained, we recommend using the estimate of the representation of the clay fraction (<0.01 mm) polynomial regression, to achieve a highest confidence value r2 at the depths of 15-20 cm 0.72 (analysette 22 microtec plus) and 0.95 (mastersizer 2000), from a depth of 40-45 cm 0.90 (analysette 22 microtec plus) and 0.96 (mastersizer 2000). since the percentage representation of clayey particles (2nd fraction according to the methodology of complex soil survey done in slovakia) in soil is the determinant for soil type specification, we recommend using the derived relationships in soil science when the soil texture analysis is done according to laser diffractometry. the advantages of laser diffraction method comprise the short analysis time, usage of small sample amount, application for the various grain size fraction and soil type classification systems, and a wide range of determined fractions. therefore, it is necessary to focus on this issue further to address the needs of soil science research and attempt to replace the standard pipette method with more progressive laser

comfort thermic condition with an increase of 1°c. other smaller zones with less relevance for users gained in cooling with a 0.5°c reduction. the new design has been detrimental to the intensity of its micro climatic regulatory function affecting the thermic comfort of the square's internal spaces, especially those formerly protected by shadow, which mitigate a high solar radiation. the study results suggest that bio-climatic analysis of public open spaces is a key component for the design of future projects as a heat mitigating tool in the context of climate change. research question is: how does the redesign of the square impact a cool urban island and the thermic comfort of users? significant differences between data in situ collected in 1990 and 2014. thermal comfort was negatively affected by the redesign in the square. the square is still a cool island but with less strength. © published under licence by iop publishing ltd.\",\n"," 'groundwater resources of mineral and

investigations of rogaška groundwaters were subjects to balneology and to demands for larger exploitation quantities, that is why information are missing that are essential for definition of the rogaška fractured aquifer system with mineral and thermo-mineral water and for its protection. the isotopic investigations of groundwaters stored in the rogaška slatina fractured aquifer system were performed aiming at answering open questions on the groundwater recharge and dynamics, on connections between different types of aquifers and on solute transport. environmental isotopes 2h, 18o, 3h, 13c of dissolved inorganic carbon and 14c were analysed in mineral, thermo-mineral and spring waters. results indicated the source and mechanism of groundwater recharge, its renewability, a transit time distribution, hydraulic interrelationships, the groundwater origin and its evolution due to effects of water-rock interaction. the mean residence time estimates of mineral and thermo- mineral water in the aquifer are between 3400 and 14000 years. on the other hand, the mixing processes between younger and older waters or mineral and spring waters are reflected as well as waters that infiltrated predominantly after the 1960s. these suggest the vulnerability of the research systems to man-made impacts. the presented results coupled with available information on a physical hydrogeology and water chemistry asses the optimal balance between the environmental protection and economic use of mineral water resources in the study area. they are essential for the protection

land cover comprises manmade surfaces, agricultural areas, forest and semi-natural areas, wetlands, and bodies of water. in slovenia more than half of the land (63%) is forested. manmade surfaces represent less than 5%. a large proportion of relatively inaccessible forest is the main reason why society had a less critical impact on forests in the past in slovenia in comparison to the majority of central european countries. regarding the high-quality landscape in the country, slovenia's natural features are characterized by a mix of forest and farmland. these land categories (i.e., complex cultivation patterns and land principally used for agriculture with significant areas of natural vegetation) cover 23% of slovenia. land-use data for farmland are gathered and provided to the relevant institutions by landowners, who are not specialists in land-use data. in addition, land use is only a two-dimensional tool, which does not recognize elevation differences and terraced slopes. terraced areas are either omitted from the inventory of land-use data because landowners do not report them, or they are included in the inventory because landowners do not realize that their land is not terraced. consequently, the differences between the official data on vineyards, orchards, and olive groves on terraces and actual terraced slopes with such land use may differ significantly. ©

buildings of the region of the valley of lecrín. it is a building of undoubted historical value. it is classified as one of cultural interest, which means maximum level of protection of the spanish legislation in historical heritage. in spite of being a historical symbol of padul, most of the citizens ignore its importance. it was built in the first part of the xvii century. d. antonio de aróstegui y zazo (knight of the santiago order and a secretary of felipe iii) was its developer. he gave the building a noble character with an unusual design for this shire. the ground floor has an l shape. besides, it has two floors and two squared towers, and standing out there is a third floor covered by a pitched roof. also, it has load-bearing walls of masonry. only the corners are built with carved stones. deck is built with logs, and bricks, and wooden roof trusses. it looks like a solid simple house of civil architecture at the beginning of the baroque style. analyzing the urban morphology of padul, the uniqueness of the plot is important related to the urban fabric. it is also remarkable its strategic position with respect to the historical roads that crossed there: the royal road that came from granada heading to the alpujarras, and leading to motril and the road that starting in malaga crossed through alhama and arrived in padul. it is clear the function of controlling the necessary passage towards the lecrin valley, the alpujarras and the mediterranean coast. immediately after its declaration in 1981 as a national monument, and despite this, it suffered an unfortunate intervention which has been maintained until today. the council of padul would like to acquire it presenting a project for its recovery. this situation provoked the invitation of the council to the university of granada to help with that. and this would allow the students of final project degree of the higher technical school of building engineering to have it as a real object to work. by focusing our attention on this building, it is intended to preserve its valuable heritage, showing its history, proposing technical solutions for preservation, and finally, to make the casa

application of traditional techniques of technical drawing in processes for automation of the design, with non-parametric cad programs, provided with scripting languages. given that an example drawing can be solved with traditional step-by-step detailed procedures, is possible to do the same with cad applications and to generalize it later, incorporating references. in today's modern cad applications, there are striking absences of solutions for building engineering: oblique projections (military and cavalier), 3d modelling of complex stairs, roofs, furniture, and so on. the use of geometric references (using variables in script languages) and their incorporation into high-level cad templates allows the automation of processes. instead of repeatedly creating similar designs or modifying their data, users should be able to use these templates to generate future variations of the same design. this paper presents the automation process of several complex drawing examples based on cad script files aided with parametric geometry calculation tools. the proposed method allows us to solve complex geometry designs not currently incorporated in the current cad applications and to subsequently create other new derivatives without user intervention. automation in the generation of complex designs not only saves time but also increases the quality of the presentations and reduces the possibility of human errors. © published under licence by iop publishing ltd.\",\n"," 'urban system is a complex mix of interdependent components and dynamic interactions between them that enable

the relevant literature, most studies consider individual components separately. on the other hand, the purpose of this paper is to assess the urban system as a whole, considering all relevant components and their interactions. the goal is a study of possibilities for holistic evaluation of urban system resilience to natural disasters. findings from the preliminary study are presented: (i) the definition of urban system and categorization of its components, (ii) a set of attributes of individual components with impact on disaster resilience of the entire system and (iii) review of different methods and approaches for resilience assessment. based on literature review and extensive preliminary studies a new conceptual framework for urban resilience assessment is proposed. in the presented paper, a conceptual model of urban system by abstraction of its components as nodes (buildings), patches - specific nodes with spatial properties (open space), links (infrastructures) and base layer (community) is created. in the suggested model, each component is defined by its own quantitative attributes, which have been identified to have an important impact on the urban system resilience to natural disasters. system is presented as a mathematical graph model. natural disaster is considered an external factor that affects the existing system and leads to some system distortion. in further analyses, mathematical simulation of various natural disasters scenarios is going to be carried out, followed by comparison of the system functionality before and after the accident. various properties of the system (accessibility, transition, complexity etc.) are going to be analysed with graph theory. the final result is going to be an identification of critical points

the feasibility and advantages of using wood-based materials in tall buildings structures and other constructive uses, which could lead to a net reduction in co2eq emissions of the construction sector by replacing high-energy consuming materials like concrete or steel, with wood and biomass-based materials. among these biomass-based materials are the non-timber forest products (ntfp)which are plantsthat canprovide important contributionsto the construction sector and help to reduce the net co2eq emissions of the building industry. one of these plants is the totora (schoenoplectus californicus) that has been long used by several communities for making handicrafts and as construction material. recent studies on this plant have analyzed its properties and its feasibility to be used for producing materials of interest to the contemporary building industry. the totora is a bulrush that grows in lakes and marshes in america from california to chile and some of the pacific islands. it grows from the sea level to 4500maasl, it can grow in fresh water and estuaries, and it is resistant to water level changes and drought. this bulrush has been used by many cultures as medicine, food, forage, material for building houses, boats and different handicrafts. the most important examples of the use of totora in the world are the floating islands of the uros in lake titicaca. the uros people have developed traditional techniques for building their homes, boats, and even the artificial islands where they live on with methods based almost exclusively on the totora. this way of living and production system has been maintained for more than 500 years. this review is about the main constructive techniques that have been used for traditional construction in totora and some of therecent researches that have been made on this subject. experiments in architecture and industrial design objects made with totora have shown its versatility, durability and high aesthetic value which is exploited in object design and architectural finishes. additionally, recent studies on the insulating capacity of totora samples have determined an average conductivity of 0,06w/mk, which is comparable to some of the common insulating materials in the current market. the review of the historical uses and recent studies on this material indicate its potential in the contemporary construction field along with other environmental benefits. one of the key features is the totora productivity that can be as much as 56 tons of dry matter per hectare per year, which is near 5 times the average production of a conifer plantation. therefore, to foster the research about its feasible applications in the contemporary construction field could lead to the reduction of the pressure on wood forests and plantations by developing a new material source for the construction industry. © published under licence by iop publishing ltd.',\n"," 'the aqueduct of the caños de

transformations in the image of these cities that could be considered as lasting or difficult to amend. in some cities, the damage caused to urban built environment could be considered a co-lateral damage as a result of internal fighting between the people and their regimes, or the fighting between the different factions in the country or from external interference of regional or international powers. urbicide, which is defined as a deliberate destruction of cities is also another form of damaging the built environment or the city image, in which parties in an internal conflict tend to destroy symbols or quarters of their rivals to inflict a tangible damage to their social and moral believes. the impacts on the built environment and the image of the city, can result as well from non-destructive measures, for example changes in land uses or decisions to demolish specific buildings that belong to the former era will also result in a clear change in the city image. this paper highlights the types of transformation of the city images that took place as a result of the arab spring revolutions. the cases discussed in this paper focus mainly on cities from both syria and egypt. this highlighting is done in regard to the nature of change, as mentioned above, the violent transformation in the case of syrian cities and few cases in egypt and the nonviolent transformation with the examples from egypt. in case of the syrian cities the transformation is caused and sparked by the civil conflict, however the course of reconstruction of these cities after the conflict ends is argued to take one of three paths reconstruction, renovation or redevelopment. while in case of the nonviolent transformation that is taking place already in egypt, the nature of change was

different alternatives for the renovation of a building, its vulnerable community and the neighbourhood in which it is inserted. the project establishes four major objectives: (a) a physical renovation of the building, (b) social transformation in a disadvantaged environment, (c) functional evolution-from a residential model to a new hybrid model with a mixed supply of social services, and (d) the incorporation of new parameters of environmental sustainability that improve the energetic behaviour of the building (transforming it into a building of almost zero consumption). the research closes with a series of strategies and results for the case study. however, the main contribution of the work is related to the research methodology that has been developed. this is structured according to the four principles of integrated urban renovation, based on a physical, social, economic and environmental perspective. this methodology and results have been explained so that they can be transferred to other areas and experience of urban recycling in vulnerable social environments. © published under licence by iop publishing ltd.',\n"," 'the medina of tetuan has

the medina took place when the rif war had already finished (provoked by the establishment of the spanish protectorate). the widening was being built and the \"modernity\" could astonish anyone. the motives for hadj ahmed el oddi to build his own house in the heart of the medina should be searched in the \"kaida\", that is the tradition so close to the muslin character of tetuan. building inside the medina meant not only keeping the familiar tradition but following the way of life their family, neighbours, friends kept. it was considered improper to do it in a different place. they could own properties in the new quarters, but only to be rented, not to be first residence. dar oddi was built in 1920 in the city centre al-blal, the oldest quarter of the medina of tetuan. built on the foundation of a demolished house would be built as the new houses already built inside the medina by neighbours and relatives. that \\'current fashion\\' was similar to a muslin house of the beginning

article aims to determine how effective the stricter current requirements for the building envelope insolation are from the economic energy savings perspective. the article deals with a mathematical method for economic assessment of optimal building thermal insulation. the mathematical methods used in this article are based on evaluating the break-even point between the construction expenditures and the economic profit. recent research shows that energy savings achieved solely through stricter standards applied to the building envelopes are limited in their ability to achieve maximum results. as the ratio of building volume to building envelope increases, further energy saving measures applied to the building envelope produce lower energy saving effects. energy savings achieved using renewable energy resources, recuperation systems are much more effective. research shows that much greater effect can be achieved by combining optimal building envelope energy efficiency measures with new requirements related to renewable energy sources and recuperating systems, such as solar batteries, wind turbines or heat pumps. © published under licence by iop publishing ltd.',\n"," 'among

refurbishing built environment through functional reorganizing, redesign and energy efficiency measures applications could result in prolonged longevity, architectural identity preservation and interior comfort improvement. besides, implemented measures for energy efficiency, through the refurbishment process, should optimize the needs for energy consumption in treated buildings. this paper defines options in comfort improvements and redesign, without implying risks to the building longevity, analyses interventions and energy efficiency measures which would enable potential energy saving assessment in the refurbishment process of masonry buildings. this paper also discusses the different techniques that can be adopted for conservation and preservation of historical masonry buildings from the austro-hungarian period dealing with energy efficiency. the works were preceded by historical research and on-site investigations. this paper describes a methodology to quantify their

czechoslovak army. military cemeteries and memorials are mostly high quality works of architecture and art. this paper focuses on the current situation and restoration issues of military cemeteries by examining the military cemetery in zvolen. in the context of its planned reconstruction, a comprehensive tree assessment has been started in 2016. the military cemetery in zvolen, being one of the largest military cemeteries in slovakia, consists of the cemetery of the soviet army with 17,628 buried soldiers and the romanian cemetery with 11,000 buried soldiers. the romanian cemetery is one of the largest cemeteries of the romanian army in europe. both cemeteries were declared national cultural monuments in 1963. in the cemetery, dendrometrical parameters and the health condition of trees were evaluated. in total, there are 825 woody plants. in both cemeteries, coniferous trees prevail, mainly individuals of the genus thuja (49.4 %). moreover, the maintenance of greenery and the

of this paper is to estimate the saturation flow rate considering the effect of a pedestrian on right turn movements of the signalized intersections in rasht city. for this goal, 6 signalized intersections with 90 cycles of reviews were selected for the estimation of saturation flow rate by the microscopic method and also 3 right turn lanes containing radius differences with 70 cycles of reviews were collected for the investigation of the pedestrians' effects. each phase of right turn lanes cycle was divided in the pieces of 10-second period which was totally 476 sample volumes of considered pedestrians and vehicles at that period. only 101 samples of those were ranged as saturated conditions. finally, using different regression models, the best relationship between pedestrian's volume and right turning vehicles flow parameters was evaluated. the results indicate that there is a primarily linear relationship between pedestrian volume and right turning vehicles flow with r2=0.6261. according to this regression model with the increase in pedestrians, saturation flow rate will be reduced. in addition, by comparing the adjustment factor obtained in the present

rehabilitation of the vulnerable degraded socio residential fabric. public administrations in big cities and metropolitan areas are confronted with both the undercurrent need of actualization of the built stock and the rise of urban residential vulnerability. the city of barcelona, as many others, is the result of multiple phenomena with high urban and social consequences. the socio spatial integration of immigrant population, the touristic rise and gentrification processes are current situations simultaneously taking place in the city. in parallel, a framework of economic crisis in which public investments in urban and social matters decrease, provides a temporal juncture that results into an increase of social polarization and socio economic inequality that becomes evident and

complemented with very specific data supplied by the barcelona city council. the accurate knowledge of socio demographic, socioeconomic and residential and urban characteristics is crucial in order to define the very complex urban dynamics that describe in the city neighbourhoods and areas. residential vulnerability is defined as an assembly of objective conditions that relate to residential space and indicate situations of social discrimination and structural disadvantage of the population, related to a specific time and context. thus, it is relevant to analyse the concentration of certain indicators of vulnerability in specific places or neighbourhoods, to contrast its effect on the socio-residential situation and its temporal evolution in order to identify tendencies. the present study contributes to the identification of data sources and a system to calculate the purposed indicators, the elaboration of a gis analysis in order to determine the characterization of

is that today the courtyards of the high-rise residential houses have become a stagnant, functionally irrelevant area that forms a depressing nature of the outdoor living space. the uncharted area of courtyards is not being used fully which highlights a wide range of issues that applies to car parks, recreation areas, and the green areas. with the development of the urban infrastructure, the

like opening or closing windows. generally, windows are the weakest facade element concerning to thermal performance. a lower thermal resistance allows higher thermal conduction through it. when a window is very hot or cold, and the occupant is very close to it, it may result in thermal discomfort. the functionality of a ventilated double window introduces new physical considerations to a traditional window. in consequence, it is necessary to study the local effect on human comfort in function of the boundary conditions. wind, solar availability, air temperature and therefore heating and indoor air quality conditions will affect the relationship between this passive system and the indoor environment. in the present paper, the influence of thermal performance and ventilation on human comfort resulting from the construction and geometry solutions is shown, helping to choose the best solution. the presented approach shows that in order to save energy it is possible to reduce the air changes of a room to the minimum, without compromising air quality, enhancing simultaneously local thermal performance and comfort. the results of the study on the effect of two parallel

in case of integrated transportation planning and planning of green infrastructure where a multitude of actors is present. although the theory of public participation is well-developed after several decades of research, there is still a lack of practical guidelines due to the specificity of public participation challenges. the paper presents a model of public participation for integrated transport and green infrastructure planning for international project transgreen covering the area of five european countries-slovakia, czech republic, austria, hungary and romania. the challenge of the project is to coordinate the efforts of public actors and ngos in international environment in oftentimes precarious projects of transport infrastructure building and developing of green infrastructure. the project aims at developing and environmentally-friendly and safe international transport network. the proposed public participation procedure consists of five main steps-spread of information (passive), collection of information (consultation), intermediate discussion, engagement and partnership (empowerment). the initial spread of information is a process of communicating with the stakeholders, informing and educating them and it is based on their willingness to be informed. the methods used in this stage are public displays, newsletters or press releases. the second step of consultation is based on transacting the opinions of stakeholders to the decision makers. pools, surveys, public hearings or written responses are examples of the multitude of ways to achieve this objective and the main principle of openness of stakeholders. the third step is intermediate discussion where all sides of are invited to a dialogue using the tools such as public meetings, workshops or urban walks. the fourth step is an engagement based on humble negotiation, arbitration and mediation. the collaborative skill needed here is dealing with conflicts. the final step in the procedure is partnership and empowerment employing methods as multi-actor decision making, voting or referenda. the leading principle is cooperation. in this ultimate step, the stakeholders are becoming

greater ability to host art interventions, like historical centers, urban sprawl areas, gardens and parks, new residential districts, among others. also in port cities, its waterfronts constitute privileged spaces for the placement of public art. on lisbon\\'s riverfront, we can see a relevant number of works and of monuments of strong symbolic nature. in turn, the placement of public art is a way to value the inherently symbolic nature of the waterfronts and to emphasize its monumentality. however, the criteria for the placement of public art on those spaces are not always clear. in some cases, there are some thematic correspondences between the works and the places, namely with the theme of the water, the discoveries and others like that. nevertheless, we cannot observe a profound spatial integration, or a design with the context. in some cases, the artistic elements are produced with a logic of isolated work of art and later they are acquired and placed in some public space. in other cases, we assist to an unusual situation: a work is conceived in a strict relation with a place, but then, without any evident justification, it is dislocated to a completely different context. or simply it is removed, disappearing from the public space. although it seems a strange situation, such kind of dislocations often occurs in lisbon. on this framework, this research proposes a discussion about the processes of implementation of public art. we will analyze two cases of public art replacement:1) the monument primeira travessia aérea do atlântico sul (first aerial crossing of the south atlantic), by laranjeira santos and rodrigues fernandes, 1972 and 2) the public sculpture ribeira das naus, by charters de almeida, 1995. both works were designed to very specific and important places on lisbon\\'s waterfront and both were later replaced to other locations on the inner city, quite far from the river. this kind of \"(de)monumentalization\" of a space originates the following questions: why is a work removed from a public space and why it is decided to give it another destination? what are the implications of those changes? is public art removable? considering public art besides its purely aesthetic significance, this phenomenon seems to reveal that the physical and the social integration with the place are not always important, or, at least, they are only important in some moments. also, we can see it from another point of view: a removal or a replacement of a work always reveals specific strategies for certain places, in certain moments. we can thus conclude that the processes of implementation of public art are clearly indicators of the policies and of the dynamics of the cities. © published under licence by iop publishing ltd.',\n"," 'the small

(1846-1923), priest, jurist and pedagogue, broke with traditional pedagogy and revolutionized the old-fashion model of education that was in vogue until that moment and universalized and socialized education. that pioneer model promoted an education based on aptitudes and faculties, using games and practice, addressed to all ages and social classes, in conjunction with nature. outdoor education

need of rethinking the local governance through the use of ict related to cities, focused on the modernization of the processes associated with urban planning. nowadays, in several societies the paradigm about cities if shifting, from an expansionist way of acting towards a regeneration and rehabilitation approach. in the case of portugal, the local authorities the municipalities are the main responsible for the coordination, and integration of policies with territorial impacts. however, these policies are generally onerous and inefficient, triggering communication and information failures in between local administration and citizens. in this sense, governance should support the decision-making process related to cities' policies, engaging citizens and socio-economic agents. as the main result in this scenario, the use of ict demonstrates the ability to play an important role in urban planning, by contributing as a simplifying tool, regarding the information and knowledge sharing, gathering local authorities, citizens and socio-economic agents. on the one hand, they promote the reduction of inefficiencies associated to the urban planning process. on the other hand, they boost the development of networks, and consequently the social and territorial cohesion. in summary, the use of ict infrastructures works as a glue allowing the integration of several intelligence elements of the city, and operating as their base platform. finally, the literature has revealed that the use of ict in urban planning should be seen as a means to a wider social goal, and not as an end by itself. with the use of ict, urban planning authorities are more likely to be aware of the city features in their multiple aspects, being able to define and monitoring the public policies, suitable to each situation, reinforcing the democracy and transparency of local governance. © published under licence by iop publishing ltd.\",\n"," 'spatial structure of places has gone through significant

the relation between acoustic and religious buildings design throughout history. it is also a mean of understanding the knowledge of acoustics principles that the cistercian order bequeathed to portugal. this paper presents an empirical approach on cistercian monastic churches acoustics. these spaces are the place where the greatest acoustic efforts are concentrated and it is also the space where the liturgy reaches greater importance. on the other hand, portugal is a country which has an important cistercian legacy over several periods of history. consequently, the portuguese cistercian monastic churches are representative of the development of the liturgy, the design of spaces and of the acoustic requirements of their churches since the 12th century until the 21st century and it is of great importance to implement this study. © published under licence by iop publishing ltd.',\n"," \"nowadays, urban roundabouts are one of the most popular types of intersections that have grown highly all over the world. thus, the accurate and engineering design of these types of intersections has a significant effect on improving their traffic performance. the capacity is one of the important traffic parameters in different intersections, which represents the maximum volume of vehicles entering the roundabouts. there are two general methods for determining the capacity of intersections including the use of analytical models such as gap acceptance model and the use of empirical methods (regression model). in the present paper, using the collected data such as entry and circulating volume, both accepted and rejected gaps were studied for three urban roundabouts and the capacity model have been determined by the use of analytical method. after implementation of the data, they became consistent and homogeneous in four different groups and the most optimized range of critical gaps as well as the follow up time were separately determined for each of these groups by using conventional methods such as sigloch, raff, wu, and harder and according to statistical analyses with a confidence level of 95%. from the obtained results, a range of 3.03 - 3.32 s for critical gap of the studied roundabouts and the range of 1.3 - 1.7 s for follow up time could be mentioned. it was used from the theory of gap acceptance in order to determine urban roundabouts capacity model, in which these gaps have a random nature and follow negative exponential distribution and by conducting this analysis (also has been used by sigloch), some relations were obtained for determining the capacity of the roundabouts according to the impact of circulating volume and drivers' behaviour. the results indicate that the maximum capacity of the roundabouts in the microscopic models is equal to 2400 veh/h, when the circulating flow rate is reached zero. moreover, according to the obtained capacity model, the circulating flow never falls down to zero in the case that it reaches its peak value. © published under licence by iop publishing ltd.\",\n"," 'the building sector is primarily responsible for a major part of total energy consumption. the european energy performance of buildings directives (epbd) emphasized the need to reduce the energy consumption in buildings, and put forward the rationale for developing near to zero energy buildings (nzeb). passive and active strategies help architects to minimize the use of active hvac systems, taking advantage of the available natural resources such as solar radiation, thermal variability and daylight. the building envelope plays a decisive role in passive and active design strategies. the ideal transparent facade would be one with optical properties, such as solar heat gain coefficient (shgc) and visible transmittance (vt), that could readily adapt in response to changing climatic conditions or occupant preferences. the aim of this article consists of describing the system to maintain a small glazed pavilion located in sofia (bulgaria) at the desired interior temperature over a whole year. the system comprises i) the use of water flow glazing facades (wfg) and radiant interior walls (riw), ii) the use of free cooling devices along with traditional heat pump connected to photo-voltaic panels and iii) the use of a new energy management system that collects data and acts accordingly by controlling all components. the effect of these strategies and the use of active systems, like water flow glazing, are analysed by means of simulating the prototype over one year. summer and winter energy management strategies are discussed in order to change the shgc value of the water flow glazing and thus, reduce the required energy to maintain comfort conditions. © published under licence by iop publishing

design intervene in the ability of the light shaft to produce its air change process. urban areas continuously pollute the air in cities which affects the human health and the environment sustainability. poor air quality outside buildings supposes a big energy waste to promote an acceptable air quality inside buildings. that requires a large flow rate to maintain the indoor air quality which is translated to an energy efficiency term. the main objective focuses on the impact of standardized architecture design in the quality of the indoor air dependent on the air change in the light shaft. the air change capacity of the outdoor space is numbered analysed using the concept of air change efficiency (ace). ace is determined by the built environment, the wind conditions and the design of the building containing light shafts. this concept is comparatively evaluated inside a control domain virtually defined to obtain the mean age of the air for a known air volume. the longer the light shaft in the wind direction is, the better the ace is compared with other options. light shafts up to 12 metres high are the most suitable in order to obtain acceptable efficiency results. other studied cases verify that assumption. different simplified tools for the technicians to evaluate the design of buildings containing light shafts are proposed. some strategies of architectural design of buildings with light shafts to be used for ventilation are presented. © published under licence by iop publishing ltd.',\n"," \"at the end of the 17th century, when the académie royale

related to architecture, remains to the present day. through the centuries, this division has been perceived as a problem or as an advantage depending on the specific event, project or construction. however, at the end of the 19th century, when reinforced concrete came into the world of construction, both branches started an interesting collaboration that produced not just marvelous buildings but also helped to evolve architecture. this collaboration started in france and then spread to spain, italy and the rest of europe. as an example of the work that these professionals carried out together was the team formed in the late fifties of the last century by two architects, bruno morassutti and angelo mangiarotti and an engineer, aldo favini. they worked together in italy projecting amazing and very significant works, such as the church of mater misericordiae which was constructed in milan between the years 1956 and 1958. one of the main conclusions is that an adequate approach in the

based on previous studies we focus our attention on the design of \"praça do comércio\" square and on a hypothesis, that it was based on the french royal square. we demonstrate that the design of lisbon from the second half of the eighteenth-century was influenced by the theories and best practices of the time. we also confirm that the architect eugénio dos santos e carvalho, a member of the reconstruction team for the baixa, had in his personal library several reference books of french architectural practice that certainly influenced his architecture. the plans for the main square of lisbon\\'s lower city, \"praça do comércio\", can be compared to the \"place de nos conquêtes\", predecessor of the \"place vêndome\", in its design, architecture and dimensions. this research analysed the cartography and iconography of lisbon\\'s reconstruction. in particular, the drawings of \"praça do comércio\" and \"place de nos conquêtes\" were exhaustively studied. the comparative study of the elements for both squares lead to the conclusion that the portuguese square presents many aspects of the french age of enlightenment, and in particular those featured in the \"place de nos conquêtes\". this paper concludes that the portuguese urban design and architectural projects of the 18th century are the result of previous knowledge where it was always possible to articulate the vernacular with academic design, and where many different influences left their mark on the culture of the period. the plans for the lower part of lisbon display a mixture of references that

environment. not only because it promotes a less polluted atmosphere among the always dense and busy urban fabric, but also because it avoids several traffic problems. the use of bicycles, or mechanic mechanisms to support the pedestrian mobility is an emerging requirement of cities' quality. in this sense, this article aims to discuss the soft mobility as a requirement of smart cities having as a case study one mountain urban area. it refers to the urban area of covilhã on the highest mountain of portugal with nearly two thousand meters high. during the last decades, this city's transformation process has driven to an urban sprawl to the suburbs, increasing the efforts in terms of transportation required by the commuters. in fact, the number of inhabitants living in the city centre is decreasing in favour of the peripheral neighbourhoods. at the same time a set of several mechanic mechanisms such as public lifts, has been built in order to promote a soft pedestrian mobility. however, in many cases, because of the lack of connection and continuity of pedestrian paths in between these mechanisms, they are not allowing a pedestrian mobility network at the city scale. thus, this paper aims to present a set of good practices in terms of pedestrian mobility network at the city scale, in order to promote a smarter urban environment. the principal results are that soft mobility is a key issue in order to turn cities smarter, among several other factors such as smart economy, smart people, smart governance or smart living. the major conclusions show that the concerns with mobility are key tools to achieve the smart city sustainability, providing and efficient and flexible traveling across the urban fabric, boosting the use of non-polluting ways of mobility. at the

certification procedure. such database is used in this paper where the majority of buildings in the database have already gone under some form of partial retrofitting - replacement of windows or installation of thermal insulation but still have poor energy performance. the case study presented in this paper utilizes energy certificates database obtained from residential units in croatia (over 400 buildings) in order to determine the dependence between buildings energy performance and variables from database by using statistical dependencies tests. building energy performance in database is presented with building energy efficiency rate (from a+ to g) which is based on specific annual energy needs for heating for referential climatic data [kwh/(m2a)]. independent variables in database are surfaces and volume of the conditioned part of the building, building shape factor, energy used for heating, co2 emission, building age and year of reconstruction. research results presented in

most important actions was the construction of the bella vista compost plant in 2012 (within the largest in south america). in the present work we analysed the possibility to use urban organic waste (that for rosario city represents about 58% of the total waste in the last years) for: a) compost production and b) biogas production, with compost as a by-product. we determined the produced compost and biogas and the corresponding greenhouse gases (ghg) emissions, considering three possible scenarios: a reference scenario (sr ) where 24 100 tons of urban solid waste per year is transported from the city houses and buildings to a transfer landfill and then to the a final disposal landfill a scenario number one (s1 ) in which the same fraction of waste is transported to the compost plant and

the second one, about the optimization of the survey as a high-resolution mesh to have a scaled 3d model to be printed in 3d, for the musealization of the verdaguer house of literature in vil.la joana (barcelona), a project developed by the museum of history of barcelona, in tribute to jacint verdaguer. in the first place, we propose a methodology for the survey of this atypical model, which is of special interest for several factors: the geometric complexity in relation to the occlusions, the thickness of the metallic surfaces, the hidden internal structure partially seen from the outside, the produced noise in its interior, and the instrumental errors. these factors make the survey process complex from the data collection, having to perform several scans from different positions to cover the entire sculpture, which has a geometry composed of a variety of folds that cause occlusions. also, the union of the positions and the average of the surfaces is of great relevance, since the elements of the sculpture are constructed by a metal plate of 2mm, therefore, the error in the union of all these many positions must be smaller than this. moreover, optimization of the cloud has a great difficulty because of the noise created by the instrumental error as it is a metal sculpture and because of noise point clouds that are generated inside the internal folds of the wings, which are made with a welded wire mesh with little spaces between them. finally, the added difficulty that there is an internal structure between elements of the parts of the drac that are partially hidden and therefore cannot be recorded. secondly, we expose the procedures performed to move from a point cloud to an optimal high-resolution mesh to be printed in 3d, adapting it to all the limitations that this printing technique entails. on the one hand, for the meshing process, a previous classification of the point cloud by pieces (wings, chains, mosaics, head ..) is made and an internal structure is re-assembled to avoid floating parts. on the other hand, the selection of the 3d printing technique, in this case fdm (fused deposition modelling), limits the size of the model so it needs to be cut by determined maximum dimension, and also it limits the minimum thickness of the model's surface, that is to say, the model cannot be directly scaled to the desired size because the 2mm surfaces would be too thin to be printed. this research intends to advance the knowledge of data acquisition, optimization, modelling and 3d printing, with a case study of great complexity. a process that can be systematized and applied to other models. © published under licence by iop publishing ltd.\",\n"," 'natural light in the cistercian churches is closely linked not only with the

century forward) is characterized by austerity, simplicity and the play of light and shadow that gives value to the monastic architectural space itself, making it perfect for a contemplative experience. in the cistercian monastery the church is the central piece of the monastic building. nave, transept and apse are the main architectural components to which is added the choir. this paper contextualizes the importance and close connections of natural light, within the cistercian monasteries architecture. thus the essence of daylight is analysed within the church of the monastery of s. bento de cástris, in évora, portugal. this former monastery (13th-19th centuries) includes the church, at the south-eastern corner which has not only a high choir, but also a low lateral choir (within the presbytery). its unchanged exterior walls are made of solid masonry. although the function of the walls is primarily structural, the windows allow the daylight to penetrate the space of the church. the church has two external façades facing northeast and southeast. the combined orientation effect of the church\\'s main axis and the sun trajectory determines how the sunlight reaches the interior of this architectural structure. this study presents the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the luminous environment in the church of s. bento de cástris, being the first based on the

variated, affected by space weather, seasonal and solar cycle changes. ionospheric activity conditions depending on mentioned factors can be analyzed by latpos system data. some data processing strategies has been developed and latpos rtk network performance results obtained, during different ionospheric activity conditions. this paper focused on both segments: the nrtk performance and the rover receiver coordinate determination possibilities in field when high ionospheric activity occurs. © published under licence by iop publishing ltd.',\n"," 'alkali-activated materials (aam) exhibit

maintain comfort conditions in residential buildings along a full year period, the use of active systems is generally required to either supply heating or cooling. the heating and cooling demands strongly depend on the climatic conditions, type of building and occupants' behaviour. the overall annual energy consumption of the building can be reduced by the use of renewable energy sources

consequence, the overall energy consumption of the building is generally lower as compared to the case when no pcm systems are used. the selection of the pcm melting temperature is a key issue to reduce the energy consumption of the buildings. the main focus of this study is to determine the optimum pcm melting temperature for passive heating and cooling according to different weather

modulus. this is due to their different pull-out mechanism and a larger number of individual fibres per kilo compared to steel fibres. macro synthetic fibres bond to the concrete along their full length, usually with an embossed surface, while steel fibres are mostly anchored by their hooked ends. if the bond is defined by the length of the embossed surface, logically the longer the synthetic fibre the higher post-crack capacity. in this paper the same type of macro synthetic fibre was researched with different lengths but at the same dosage. the consistency of the fresh concrete together

exposure at high temperatures and the development of alkali silica reactions. in addition, and taking in mind that the failure mechanism in frc is strongly related with the fibre pull-out strength, the bond strength in damaged matrices was shown concluding that the residual bond strength is less affected than the matrix strength. as the damage increases, the compressive strength and the modulus of elasticity decrease, being the modulus of elasticity the most affected. there were no significant changes produced by the incorporation of fibres on the residual behaviour when compared with previous experience on plain damage concrete. regarding the tensile behaviour although the first peak decreases as the damage increases, even for a severely damage frc the residual stresses remain almost unaffected. © 2017 published under licence by iop publishing ltd.',\n"," 'this paper presents the results of a study examining the effect of steel fibres on the blast behaviour of high-strength

ratios ρ were larger than ∼2% cracking localization was diminished. furthermore, for low values of ρ, m/n ratios of the specimens with lower fibre contents are somewhat larger than those of the specimens with larger content. it is also shown that as the reinforcement ratio decreases below ∼0.5% the normalized mid-span ultimate deflections decreases as well, which corresponds with the observation of the cracking localization phenomenon for low reinforcement ratios. for larger reinforcement ratio, when m/n increases above ∼0.6, there is no effect of cracking localization on the

give the concrete a residual flexural strength after the first cracks. the different behaviour of materials subjected to different loading rates is a well-known phenomenon, both with steel, synthetic and concrete materials. standards usually present a recommendation for the loading speed in for different tests. concrete elements show higher performance due to the high speed of loading or impact loads, their fracture energy and therefore their overall capacity appears greater than the specimens loaded at standard speeds. fibre reinforced concrete structures are widely used in tramlines and railways, where the speed of the loading is high and therefore of impact by nature. it is important to know what the effect of this high speed loading is for fibre reinforced concrete structures: do

followed by thermogravimetric analysis (tg) technique. the effect of gas composition, gas pressure and temperature on the rate of reduction was investigated. the different phases formed during the

africa, with fatigue cracking being one of the major forms of premature pavement distress. in response, it has become a national aspiration to incorporate a performance related fatigue test into the binder specifications for south africa. the binder yield energy test (byet) was the first in a series of tests analysed for its potential to predict the fatigue performance of the binder. the test is performed with the dynamic shear rheometer, giving two key parameters, namely, yield energy and shear strain at maximum shear stress (γτmax). the objective of the investigation was to perform a rudimentary evaluation of the byet followed by a more in-depth investigation should the initial byet results prove promising. the paper discusses the results generated from the byet under eight different conditions, using six different binders. the results are then correlated with four point bending beam fatigue test results obtained from asphalt mix samples that were manufactured from the same binders. final results indicate that the byet is not ideal as an indicator of fatigue performance. © published under licence by iop publishing ltd.',\n"," 'secondary effects of intersections

achieves the dynamic balancing condition by resorting to counter-devices approach, however, by doing this, one adds extra weight and therefore the inertia are increased inside the whole system, which is not cost-effective when the system is sent into space and later used in space. in this study, it is suggested one is able to achieve the reactionless condition through combining the self-balanced system. for example, the dynamic balancing condition can be realized via the reconfiguration concept. extra counter-mass is not employed but through reconfiguring the whole structure, in this way, the system will not get to be heavy and therefore, reduce the energy costs and make the system more applicable and flexible for space applications. based on this concept, first and foremost, one needs to balance a single component through the reconfiguration approach (i.e. decomposition process) and after that integrate the above balanced components to build the entire system (i.e. integration process). finally, with the mechanical reconfiguration, the control laws governing the operation of the mechanism also need to be changed, so as to make whole systems more flexible when they are used

are responsible for a large part of the thermodynamic losses. especially, the suction valve, which is opened nearly during the whole suction stroke, has a big potential for improvement. usually, suction valves are opened only by vacuum created by the moving piston and should be closed before the compression stroke starts to avoid a reversed mass-flow through the valve. therefore, the valves are prestressed, which results on the other hand in a higher flow resistance. in this work, a suction valve is investigated, which is not closed by the preload of the valve but by an electromagnetic coil located in the suction muffler neck. shortly before the piston reaches its bottom dead centre, voltage is applied to the coil and a magnetic force is generated which pulls the valve shut. thereby, the flow resistance through the valve can be reduced by changing the preload on the reed valve because it is no longer needed to close the valve. the investigation of this adapted valve and the electromagnetic coil is firstly done by numerical simulations including fluid structure interactions of the reed valves of a reciprocating compressor and secondly by experiments made on a

compressor, the load condition was not considered in the behaviour of the piston. in some papers, behaviour of piston is assumed as sinusoidal motion provided by user defined function (udf). in the reciprocating type compressor, the stroke of the piston is restrained by the rod, while the stroke of the linear compressor is not restrained, and the stroke changes depending on the load condition. the greater the pressure difference between the discharge refrigerant and the suction refrigerant, the more the centre point of the stroke is pushed backward. and the behaviour of the piston is not a complete sine wave. for this reason, when the load condition changes in the cfd analysis of the linear compressor, it may happen that the ansys code is changed or unfortunately the modelling is changed. in addition, a separate analysis or calculation is required to find a stroke that meets the load condition, which may contain errors. in this study, the coupled mechanical equations and electrical equations are solved using the udf, and the behaviour of the piston is solved considering the pressure difference across the piston. using the above method, the stroke of the piston with

by the piston motion and pressure difference between the compression chamber and the shell internal environment. in compressors adopted for domestic refrigeration, such a clearance is usually filled by a mixture of refrigerant and lubricating oil. besides its lubricating function, the oil also acts as sealing element for the piston-cylinder clearance, and hence leakage is expected to be more

in majority of modern branches of industry for pumping of dirty media. the main task of researchers of torque flow pumps is increase of such pumps effectiveness for higher feed. hydraulic losses for torque flow pumps are caused by working process of such pumps and are inevitable. decrease of losses can be obtained by means of optimization of hydraulic flow part geometry. modern approach to design of pump outlet introduces new constructive solutions which can increase economy of torque flow pumps. the aim of this research is increase of economy of torque flow pumps by means of application of spatial outlet and investigation of its geometry on pump characteristics. analytical and numerical methods of liquid flow research for hydraulic flow part of torque flow pump were used in this paper. moreover, influence of hydraulic flow part geometry of different designs of \"turo\" type torque flow pumps outlets on pump characteristics was investigated. numerical research enabled to study process of energy transfer of torque flow pump and evaluate influence of geometrical dimensions of spatial spiral outlet on its characteristics. besides numerical research confirmed introduced regularity of peripheral velocity distribution in outlet. velocity moment distribution in outlet was obtained during implementation of numerical research. implemented bench tests of torque flow pump prototypes enabled to obtain real characteristics of pump and confirm effectiveness of spatial geometry of outlet application for such pump. © published under licence by iop publishing ltd.',\n","
